Sarah booked the band for her wedding and it seems they went down a storm. &#39;The Jacks were fantastic when they played at our wedding! We really can&#39;t recommend them highly enough. Communication before the event was good and they turned up at the promised time on the day. They set up quickly and sorted out playing our first dance song for us on an iPod before their set started. Every song they played in both sets was a belter, I don&#39;t think I left the dance floor all evening and it was packed with both our younger and older guests dancing. They coped admirably well with our slightly tipsy best man trying to join in with the singing and were generally good humoured throughout the night. All round brilliant, thanks guys!&#39;. High five to the boys for being awesome and thank you to Sarah for the lovely comments! <a href=\"http://www.warble-entertainment.com/hire/the-jacks/848/\" class=\"ot-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.warble-entertainment.com/hire/the-jacks/848/</a> <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23weddingband\">#weddingband</a> <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23partyband\">#partyband</a>  <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23bandforhire\">#bandforhire</a> \u00a0", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 10, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z125x3tqruy5fzw3g223ubyjutzxc3fwg04/people/plusoners"}, "replies": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z125x3tqruy5fzw3g223ubyjutzxc3fwg04/comments"}, "id": "z12hwjzphzyec3oem22sup0hsq3vhnj33", "objectType": "activity"}, "updated": "2013-10-22T12:16:05.367Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/100296801660221067982", "image": {"url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-3aEVxGJ1N8E/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAA2U/DJAr72UlmNo/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Matt Warren", "id": "100296801660221067982"}, "annotation": "Nice work chaps! :D", "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "Public"}, "verb": "share", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/lOew8dvpN_o_i5OoaJmK3bitTHA\"", "published": "2013-10-22T12:16:05.367Z", "id": "z125x3tqruy5fzw3g223ubyjutzxc3fwg04"}, "NONE"]
