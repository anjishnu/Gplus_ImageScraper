The situation of the town is very charming, occupying a broadish basin, and surrounded on all sides by hills, save on that which is bounded by the sea. On the north are Killiney and Two Rocks; on the west are the mountains at the back of Enniskerry; more to the south are the Sugar Loaves, with the lofty range of Douce, which, as seen from Bray Head, rises directly from the town. From all these hills wooded shoulders are thrown out, softening their stern features, and insensibly merging into the well-kept grounds and parks of the many residences in the neighbourhood.&quot;<br /><br />Descriptive letterpress from the book &#39;Photographs of Co.
