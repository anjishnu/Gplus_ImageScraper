If you have a lot of words they\u2019ll become like some muscle you\u2019ve developed that you\u2019re compelled to use, and you must use this one in expressing yourself or in criticizing others. It\u2019s hard to say who\u2019ll punish you the most for this, the dumb people who don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about or the learned ones who do. But wallop you they will and you\u2019ll be forced to confine yourself to pen and paper.<br /><br />Then you\u2019ll be a writer and may God have mercy on your soul.<br /><br />No! A thousand times no! Far, far better confine yourself to a few simple expressions in life, the ones that served billions upon countless billions of our forefathers and still serve admirably all but a tiny handful of those at present clinging to the earth\u2019s crust\u2026<br /><br />So forget all that has hitherto attracted you in our complicated system of grunts and go back to those fundamental ones that have stood the test of time.<br /><br />~ F.
