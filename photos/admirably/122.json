Once you&#39;ve locked onto your subject, iPhone 5 mitigates a shaky hand extremely well - even in low light situations. The slightest movement (as we all know) can ruin a photo with undue blur.<br /><br />&quot;Reduced motion blur&quot; was advertised as a feature of iPhone 5, and whether it&#39;s optical image\u00a0stabilization\u00a0or\u00a0something\u00a0similar - it definitely works, and you can see it in action before every snap (if you jitter your hand slightly, the composition compensates automatically).\u00a0<br /><br />Here&#39;s a single-handed shot with the AE/AF lock on my reflection in the computer screen. While other lines aren&#39;t as sharp, they&#39;re also not blurred from a shaky hand. \u00a0If this is how well it works in low light, it should perform admirably with ample light.\u00a0", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12zxdxrclb3tjfvh22tvfeozqutil1ys04/people/plusoners"}, "replies": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12zxdxrclb3tjfvh22tvfeozqutil1ys04/comments"}, "id": "z13hvjzpgl2bz1bar04ch5jartnuutap1bo", "objectType": "activity"}, "updated": "2012-09-22T07:19:48.042Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/105965262911473588228", "image": {"url": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-hkzO0_8NTHY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABY8/ROdBbWatocw/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Ryan Kubo", "id": "105965262911473588228"}, "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "Public"}, "verb": "share", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/hKnYJYD2nrS2Ko0WMmiJfnlFogg\"", "published": "2012-09-22T07:19:48.042Z", "id": "z12zxdxrclb3tjfvh22tvfeozqutil1ys04"}, "NONE"]
