They had been pursuing the Goblinoid forces into and then across the desert sands, killing all who they could catch. Catching them, however, was proving easier said than done with this elusive foe, and matters at court would need his guiding hand if they were to take advantage of the Slayer missteps these last few days.<br /><br />&quot;Sir Ingvar,&quot; he said, turning to the knight who had ridden at his side.<br /><br />&quot;Your Grace,&quot; the knight responded with a bow.<br /><br />&quot;I entrust you to lead this force, as you acquitted yourself admirably at Knight&#39;s Bridge. Now drown this damn desert in blood. I want it to be at least fifty years before they even think of coming against our border again. I will return to Rotheim on the morrow.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;As my liege commands,&quot; Sir Ingvar responded with a deep bow.", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z122z5mz5zmvd5e5a04cf1wirseehbnqkj0/people/plusoners"}, "replies": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z122z5mz5zmvd5e5a04cf1wirseehbnqkj0/comments"}, "id": "z12kvngh1qbrhfs2523zirmqyt3mvpcod04", "objectType": "activity"}, "updated": "2013-05-10T05:30:58.750Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/117512043340070301127", "image": {"url": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-kSU8dm55K7s/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/tLPga6SfEBY/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Marie Wessels", "id": "117512043340070301127"}, "annotation": "Snippet 2!", "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "Tales of Teana (Discussion)"}, "verb": "share", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/6NeRzuHelKl_Q8caKvJ45qWjsnw\"", "published": "2013-05-10T05:30:58.750Z", "id": "z122z5mz5zmvd5e5a04cf1wirseehbnqkj0"}, "NONE"]
