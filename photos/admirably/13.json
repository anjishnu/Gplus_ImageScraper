It\u2019s one of the best debuts from any metal band I can think of from the early 80\u2019s. The musicianship is solid and the band keeps their foot on the accelerator from start to finish. Front-man Paul Di'Anno\u2019s raw, in-your-face, punk-like vocals complement the songs admirably. I cannot think of a better lead singer for the first two Maiden studio albums. With tracks like Sanctuary, Running Free, Phantom of the Opera, Strange World, and Iron Maiden on this album, these guys were destined for \u201cmetal\u201d success. Over thirty years and many albums later, they\u2019re still touring, still rocking! So, who\u2019s going to dress up like Eddie the Head (cover art) for Halloween?
