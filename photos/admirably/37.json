I&#39;d never stayed in the particular hotel before and didn&#39;t realise it offered any sort of views. Even if I had realised it had views I would never have expected to get access to said views given I booked the room on the cheap through one of the last minute booking websites.\u00a0<br /><br />Yet on the spur of the moment as I was about to leave home I decided to grab my camera and obviously when I opened the door to the room on the 35th floor and saw the view I was glad I did. And as always the OMD performed admirably.\u00a0<br /><br />I guess I&#39;ll call this a lesson in why you should take your camera everywhere, even when you have no obvious reason for doing so.\u00a0<br /><br />Cheers, Chris<br /><br /> <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23sydney\">#sydney</a> \u00a0 <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23HDR\">#HDR</a> \u00a0 <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23nightscape\">#nightscape</a> \u00a0 <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23cityscape\">#cityscape</a> \u00a0 <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23OMD\">#OMD</a> \u00a0", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 3, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13kv1wamlj1f5ghv04cdzk5pnfivrl5qg0/people/plusoners"}, "replies": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13kv1wamlj1f5ghv04cdzk5pnfivrl5qg0/comments"}, "id": "z12hz53xpprhzddqp04cdhbjtmbvzb0odhg", "objectType": "activity"}, "updated": "2013-08-21T09:09:49.959Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/114959293759305133842", "image": {"url": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-iD_MmNsRrGA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADA/kFxRum81xlw/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Blue Mountains Backpacker Hostel", "id": "114959293759305133842"}, "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "Public"}, "verb": "share", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/RCXZX-jFOWO4QmCZa52z5ol_V6o\"", "published": "2013-08-21T09:09:49.959Z", "id": "z13kv1wamlj1f5ghv04cdzk5pnfivrl5qg0"}, "NONE"]
