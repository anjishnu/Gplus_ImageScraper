Only one little girl was really traumatized, and it was so obviously a result of how horribly the adults around here were managing the situation. Things did get better for her though, so that was good. She took a lot of comforting, patience, and reassuring though - through everything from getting her boots on for recess to coming inside for lunch. It takes a lot of caring to help them through it when it gets that difficult, but it can be done. The rest had varying emotions about their situations, but ultimately adapted, and did well.<br /><br />Far more damaging to the kids I dealt with than divorce was abuse. Even the kids we cared for with FAS were easier to handle than the ones who had been victims of abuse. Some of those poor little ones probably never trusted anyone ever again. Even sadder, for some of them, we were probably the most stable, positive influences they&#39;d ever had in their lives up to that point.", "objectType": "comment"}, "updated": "2013-01-22T21:28:53.788Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/103897220774015362696", "image": {"url": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-c3OQW9-3mCk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAARgc/gyrLeH32I_U/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Melissa Walker", "id": "103897220774015362696"}, "verb": "post", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/qTF1zN8bLBIJ-Ng97CD42J3kOvE\"", "published": "2013-01-22T21:28:53.788Z", "id": "z13wfzbghmbhvpqca23esdgwvxqgv1gpl04.1358890133788893", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/comments/z13wfzbghmbhvpqca23esdgwvxqgv1gpl04#1358890133788893"}, {"inReplyTo": [{"url": "https://plus.google.com/103897220774015362696/posts/27zHZiPezvj", "id": "z13wfzbghmbhvpqca23esdgwvxqgv1gpl04"}], "kind": "plus#comment", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 0}, "object": {"content": "D:", "objectType": "comment"}, "updated": "2013-01-22T21:39:45.509Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/102607574612363218543", "image": {"url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--q7unYWI3Ns/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAB0/N1XsMOsWbeA/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Michael Walker", "id": "102607574612363218543"}, "verb": "post", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/IFNigMwTTu26QYVPywOKgdHYSu8\"", "published": "2013-01-22T21:39:45.509Z", "id": "z13wfzbghmbhvpqca23esdgwvxqgv1gpl04.1358890785509101", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/comments/z13wfzbghmbhvpqca23esdgwvxqgv1gpl04#1358890785509101"}, {"inReplyTo": [{"url": "https://plus.google.com/103897220774015362696/posts/27zHZiPezvj", "id": "z13wfzbghmbhvpqca23esdgwvxqgv1gpl04"}], "kind": "plus#comment", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 1}, "object": {"content": "I&#39;ve been separated from my wife for 4.5 years.
