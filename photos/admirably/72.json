Chanel\u2019s In house fragrance maestro Jacques Polge updated the classic no. 19 (Coco\u2019s signature perfume) for a new generation, infusing the effervescent chypre with notes of neroli, galbanum, jasmine, iris, white musk, vetiver and tonka bean. The end result is a fragrance that merges the modern and the traditional, into a glamorous package, much like Lagerfeld\u2019s coveted designs for the house. | 50ml \u2013 $85<br /><b>Serge Lutens Jeux de Peau</b> \u2013 As one of the most idiosyncratic names in fragrance, you can always expect the unexpected from Serge Lutens. His latest, Jeux de Peau is meant to capture the the familiar aroma of fresh baked bread, but with its heady combo of coconut, licorice, osmanthus and apricot it smells far more exotic. If you\u2019re in the mood for something warm and enveloping to take you through the seasonal chills this is it. | 50ml \u2013 $120<br /><b>Bottega Veneta</b> - Taking the two things Bottega is known for \u2013 leather and luxury \u2013 then transforming them into a perfume is no small feat, but line\u2019s first fragrance manages it admirably. Like a finely crafted Tomas Maier accessory the scent is chic and understated. A unique combination of leather, oakmoss, patchouli and florals makes for an exceptionally refined concoction. | 50ml $95", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 1, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12tfv5yfurnifjyu04cf52jvzqicrh4x04/people/plusoners"}, "replies": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12tfv5yfurnifjyu04cf52jvzqicrh4x04/comments"}, "objectType": "note"}, "updated": "2013-04-30T18:32:55.344Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/101378597127139623995", "image": {"url": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-pvbwLvcTmx0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAujU/rdLIgMivHdg/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Irina Kovalchuk", "id": "101378597127139623995"}, "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "Public"}, "verb": "post", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/TQXsB7cjPKt4utX3BKXCHU0K9u4\"", "published": "2013-04-30T18:32:55.344Z", "id": "z12tfv5yfurnifjyu04cf52jvzqicrh4x04"}, "NONE"]
