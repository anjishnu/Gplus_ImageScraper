But once I abstracted myself out of the traffic situation and looked at it from a higher perspective, it was amazing how everyone, despite the rush they were in, paused to allow the entire line of geese to cross. Not one honk (pun intended) from the cars to keep the geese from startling. The pic shows just the tail end, there were an equal number ahead out of the view by the time I clicked this picture.<br /><br />We all crib about nasty drivers on Atlanta streets, and for most part it is true. However, when I see these little things happening on our roads, I believe there is a heart even in those nasty drivers. A heart that warms up to accommodate all life that shares this planet with us.
