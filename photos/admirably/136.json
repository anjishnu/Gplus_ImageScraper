It is the old loading bay at Schoolhouse Electric building.  I like the light and shadow with the texture of the brick, it makes for a visually rich photograph.  On the walk I primarily used my 100mm macro lens and for this shot it performed admirably because the sun was quite bright so it helped to isolate the building from the rest of the landscape which helped to obtain a more pleasing contrast in the diffuse indirect light.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://blog.cranialaperture.com/2012/05/2012-day-130-loading.html\" class=\"ot-anchor\">http://blog.cranialaperture.com/2012/05/2012-day-130-loading.html</a><br /><br /> #pdxpw", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 8, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13ieb2xjvq5gdvce235uhqhcxyitzcce/people/plusoners"}, "replies": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13ieb2xjvq5gdvce235uhqhcxyitzcce/comments"}, "objectType": "note"}, "updated": "2012-05-10T03:41:47.856Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/109059323985123972456", "image": {"url": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-WN_xVGjBF_Y/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAHf4/UvYs0_6Spt8/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Jeffrey Yen", "id": "109059323985123972456"}, "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "Public"}, "verb": "post", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/UXI77HHBxBFTm41NW3kig8YIbWY\"", "published": "2012-05-10T03:41:47.856Z", "id": "z13ieb2xjvq5gdvce235uhqhcxyitzcce"}, "NONE"]
