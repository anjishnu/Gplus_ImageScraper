His bones were not particularly large except the backbone, which was immensely so. His neck rose well from his shoulders and joined his head admirably. His shoulders were wide and well placed, particularly oblique, and rising well at the withers. His back was of medium length, coupling well back; a loin wide, slightly arched and very powerful. His body was large, round and full, being ribbed in the best possible manner, very deep through the heart, which made his legs look short. His hips were not remarkably wide, though strong. His arms were not large, and his second thigh [gaskin] was peculiarly light and thin, and to our eye, was his greatest defect. His feet and legs were small and clean, with tendons large and strong as catgut. His action was superb \u2014 bold, free, elastic, and full of power.&quot;<br /><br />- The Thoroughbred Record of 9 July 1875", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 4, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12nhdoiynnyc5lj204cgbmokxubydrxneg/people/plusoners"}, "replies": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12nhdoiynnyc5lj204cgbmokxubydrxneg/comments"}, "objectType": "note"}, "updated": "2013-07-13T21:42:15.443Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/104450658073431673519", "image": {"url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1aD8_z3Ypt0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAJls/a8uCy-Mvenc/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Rocky Acres Horse Training", "id": "104450658073431673519"}, "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "Rocky Acres Horses (Breeds of Horses)"}, "verb": "post", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/-_SSVqYuokxrDB9xjJ_270KIJxI\"", "published": "2013-07-13T21:42:15.443Z", "id": "z12nhdoiynnyc5lj204cgbmokxubydrxneg"}, "NONE"]
