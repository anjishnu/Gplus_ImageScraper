While the aim of the garden is to show the exotic side of the rain forest, it does so in a safe, controlled and informative way. The grounds are criss-crossed with trails, strewn with nutmeg shells. There is an astounding assortment of plants, from spices and local fruit trees, to native flowering plants and hardwood trees. There are even a few species of flora which are not native to our island, but have been brought, either as ornamental plants, or as export producers. The owner, Keith St.Bernard, and his son will be more than delighted to show you around and tell you what each plant is. Find out how many different types of palm trees exist, or get some more knowledge of the different types of fruits which are grown on the island. You can touch, and even taste some of the fruits when they are in season.", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 2, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z130cdfr0vyrcp3tx22fe1kyvtqbhhtqy04/people/plusoners"}, "replies": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z130cdfr0vyrcp3tx22fe1kyvtqbhhtqy04/comments"}, "objectType": "note"}, "updated": "2012-03-12T07:30:38.551Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/110120582233218978699", "image": {"url": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/--0TzlihG5SI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACAg/P1Xsx8w-iOk/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Touristneeds.com", "id": "110120582233218978699"}, "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "Public"}, "verb": "post", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/r7aAmL0scMHj9CqPAXQLMCbWsi8\"", "published": "2012-03-12T07:30:38.551Z", "id": "z130cdfr0vyrcp3tx22fe1kyvtqbhhtqy04"}, "NONE"]
