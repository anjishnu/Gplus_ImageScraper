But looking at it, commuting through it, watching it on various media and now totally absorbed by it, I can see that it has achieved where all our politicians have only dreamed of achieving. <br /><br />Take for instance the following:<br />--- our girls success in Taekwondo and boxing, <br />--- the outstanding performances in rowing, cycling and equestrian,<br />--- the first female Olympian from Saudi Arabia <br />--- then there is the army of volunteers who assist visitors<br />--- the fantastic venues of which a number will remain following the completetion of the games<br />--- the excitement that has become such a familiar sound of people discussing the latest news<br /><br />It&#39;s not been all pride though... Our public transport has coped admirably but staff kicked off because of their greed wanting &#39;extra&#39; money for doing their jobs which they are paid to do in the first place. <br /><br />A Proud Nation<br />Each day I marveledl at the wonderful vibes this has given us, stress levels have reduced benifiting the health of our friends, relatives and colleagues. We have reached an impressive 3rd place in the medals table whereas 16 years ago we achieved just 1 gold. <br /><br />And what about our champions....<br />They&#39;ve been brilliant, some received medals some didn&#39;t, and what they have all done is to inspire our kids to try new sports and leave their electronic gadgets to one side.  I&#39;m sure that in the days to come we will see an uptake of physical exercise through organised sports on a scale that will impact on our fufuture participation for many years to come. <br /><br />Great Britain yes we are! A Nation who did rise to the challenge, did provide a first class Olympic games and did show the world that this small island is really something special. <br /><br />Well done everybody....<br /><br />Now for the Paralympics :-)<br />", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13dhf2xxlautpo3k22vwzbrgzipj50wl04/people/plusoners"}, "replies": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13dhf2xxlautpo3k22vwzbrgzipj50wl04/comments"}, "objectType": "note"}, "updated": "2012-08-13T07:21:39.000Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/109949548036043682920", "image": {"url": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-8Mbo8lnLp4c/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEU/X1tbpQP53L0/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Stefan Algar", "id": "109949548036043682920"}, "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "Public"}, "verb": "post", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/FFMjKXG57c0Ni9Ktigeq-meMxas\"", "published": "2012-08-13T07:20:07.010Z", "id": "z13dhf2xxlautpo3k22vwzbrgzipj50wl04"}, "NONE"]
