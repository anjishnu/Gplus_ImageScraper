It challenges cultural norms - particularly the shallowness of youth culture, the disregard for the aged, materialism, friendship\u2026<br /><br />The main character, Derek, is mentally slow and has such a wonderful heart and Ricky Gervais plays him so neatly. It really was a surprise for me. Hannah, Dougie, Kevin and the rest are played so admirably, and with such character, well - not Kevin.<br /><br />But the ending felt somewhat shallow. And maybe that because it was only 7 episodes and they wanted to give it a nice tidy ending. But \u201cBe like Derek\u201d is\u2026<br /><br />Well, it could have been more. It came off a bit shallow in the end, sweet - nice - but shallow.\u00a0<br /><br />Do watch it, its fantastic. Even with the last episode. Its a great conversation starter. And I will probably re-watch the entire season over the next few months.\u00a0<br /><br /><a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23belikederek\">#belikederek</a> <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23netflix\">#netflix</a> <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23movies\">#movies</a>", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13zf5tzsq30udxqv04cjbeigufbtrpbm0w/people/plusoners"}, "replies": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13zf5tzsq30udxqv04cjbeigufbtrpbm0w/comments"}, "objectType": "note"}, "updated": "2013-09-22T07:27:42.902Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/118379772574666816468", "image": {"url": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ljcjUdZbJzo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAGSs/r_sDkmxx-pE/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Eric Furrer", "id": "118379772574666816468"}, "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "Public"}, "verb": "post", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/NkdKEMzmRr4jkOg_Q4pRGDu7FUg\"", "published": "2013-09-22T07:27:42.902Z", "id": "z13zf5tzsq30udxqv04cjbeigufbtrpbm0w"}, "NONE"]
