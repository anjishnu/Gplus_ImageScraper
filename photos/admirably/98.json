It\u2019s about how many times we get up.<br /><br />If we live by the spiritual truth that everything in our lives is from the Creator, this includes our failures. Even in those instances where we behave less than admirably, there is Light waiting to be revealed and lessons to be learned.<br /><br />The problem is that when we fall, it\u2019s easier for us to get wrapped up in feelings of shame and remorse than it is to learn the lesson. The Opponent loves to send us on a guilt trip, taking us a far distance from the Light.<br /><br />If this sounds like a familiar pattern to you, you\u2019re not alone. This is a story that has been told since the beginning of time. The sin of Adam wasn\u2019t that he ate from the tree of knowledge. The very nature of the Creator is mercy, unconditional love and forgiveness. God forgave Adam, but it was his guilt that disconnected him from the Garden of Eden. Still today, it is the barrier that keeps us from the Creator with every mistake we make.<br /><br />This is why the Rav often taught, \u201cWhere guilt exists, the Light cannot dwell.\u201d<br /><br />It\u2019s important to remember when we slide back, it is because the Creator is trying to move us forward. Guilt prevents us from that forward movement. It keeps us stuck in the past.<br /><br />It\u2019s okay to fall. In fact, it\u2019s part of the process!", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13mgxtbtkbrujyxe04cgn1heq31sxsoixw0k/people/plusoners"}, "replies": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13mgxtbtkbrujyxe04cgn1heq31sxsoixw0k/comments"}, "objectType": "note"}, "updated": "2013-01-13T16:08:43.706Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/103338907664283384208", "image": {"url": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Cv83vzJiUHk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAADBQ/iPNLeBSkFsE/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Vivian Lo", "id": "103338907664283384208"}, "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "Public"}, "verb": "post", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/-Hy60gF08YErK89iai3hMMc0JO0\"", "published": "2013-01-13T16:08:43.706Z", "id": "z13mgxtbtkbrujyxe04cgn1heq31sxsoixw0k"}, "NONE"]
