As one would expect, a sense of glorying and joyful praise was palpable. And through the windows, I could see the city spread out below lighting its lights against the fading daylight. With the sun now gone, the beauty at hand became a self-contained Upper Room looking no more at the world, a city of light, set on a hill. The Byzantine Great Thursday, a night of humble washing of feet, Communion and betrayal, began to unfold. The account of that night some 2000 years ago according to the Gospel of John was chanted along with Psalms and prayers and processions and incense. There was no musical accompaniment. The children with their families made me think of how Jesus wanted them to come to him whether with shoes on or off. After this Service I was able to stay for part of the Melkite Service that anticipated the Good Friday Service of the Ruthenian Rite to be held the next morning. I observed how the two respectfully loved one another. For more, see the related post #1: http://goo.gl/ubOl0 Between the Services, I learned that the artist is an iconographer in residence and of riper years, some four score plus.She like others dedicated to this special work was consecrated with such a prayer: \"Thou Who hast so admirably imprinted Thy features on the cloth sent to King Abgar of Edessa, and hast so wonderfully inspired Luke Thy Evangelist: Enlighten my soul and that of Thy servant; Guide his hand that he may reproduce Thy features, those of the Holy Virgin and of all Thy saints, for the glory and peace of Thy Holy Church. Spare him from temptations and diabolical imaginations in the name of Thy Mother, St. Luke, and all the Saints. Amen.\" She follows a discipline of obedience in executing her work: Rules and Prayer for Iconographers Before starting work, make the sign of the Cross; pray in silence and pardon your enemies. Work with care on every detail of your icon, as if you were working in front of the Lord Himself. During work, pray in order to strengthen yourself physically and spiritually; avoid all useless words, and keep silence. Pray in particular to the Saint whose face you are painting. Keep your mind from distractions, and the Saint will be close to you. When you choose a colour, stretch out your hands interiorly to the Lord and ask His Counsel. Do not be jealous of your neighbour\u2019s work; his/her success is your success too. When your icon is finished, thank God that His Mercy granted you the grace to paint the Holy Images. Have your icon blessed by putting it on the Holy Table of your parish church. Be the first to pray before it, before giving it to others. Never forget: the joy of spreading icons throughout the world. the joy of the work of icon writing. the joy of giving the Saint the possibility to shine through his/her icon. the joy of being in union with the Saint whose face you are revealing. \" #Icon #iconographer #HolyAngelsByzantineCatholicChurch #Ruthenian #Melkite #sacredsunday #sacredartsunday #sacredarchitecture #GreatThursday #Triduum #sandiegophotography #HolyWeek ...", "fullImage": {"url": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-xDsN4Zjw8fg/UVdqz5SKp7I/AAAAAAAAGkI/2A5vof2wDHI/s288/photo.jpg", "width": 1258, "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 982}, "url": "https://plus.google.com/photos/100679016435898597312/albums/5861270876383165457/5861270879828879282?sqi=105706580986253238193&sqsi=6bf1b395-9fd0-4fa5-90c1-23d0bd8517d9", "image": {"url": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-xDsN4Zjw8fg/UVdqz5SKp7I/AAAAAAAAGkI/2A5vof2wDHI/w506-h750/photo.jpg", "width": 506, "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 750}, "content": "HA Washing feet icon IMG_0806.JPG", "id": "100679016435898597312.5861270879828879282", "objectType": "photo"}], "url": "https://plus.google.com/100679016435898597312/posts/JqrNEdCCqmo", "content": "~~~<br /><b>Great Thursday</b><br /><b>Holy Angels (Byzantine-Ruthenian) Catholic Church</b><br />San Diego<br />#2<br /><br />From the simple exterior, I passed through the foyer and inner doors into the Church proper and an amazing array of brilliantly colored icons on every wall and even covering the ceiling.
