Some photographers do these tests where they figure out how sharp it is by putting it in a static environment and taking photographs at various settings. Turns out my 28mm did this admirably! To the front and back of &quot;ALERT&quot; it should all be out of focus as the lens was pushed to the point of being only milimetres away of being out of focus. At the settings used it is rarely this sharp. Nice. Only, I&#39;m not fussed. The only thing that bothers me is that it does its job time after time again at weddings. Forget static scenarios, if I can&#39;t shoot people how I need to then there is no point doing these tests. I guess my test is in the real world: of weddings.
