People line up to get themselves infected with celebrities viruses in order to feel what they feel. An employee of one of the premiere companies that offers these services infects himself with what turns out to be a deadly virus from one of the most famous celebrities. It&#39;s a race to find a cure before he and the celebrity dies. <br /><br />This is quite an impressive debut from Brandon Cronenberg, son of the famous David Cronenberg. It&#39;s stark and sterile cinematography sets a grim mood which is relentless and somewhat soul shattering. Only broken up by vivid red blood against a white background. This is a world in which superficiality rules and is damn depressing. <br /><br />It&#39;s obviously meant to be a satirical view on our celebrity obsessions. And it succeeds admirably. For gore fans, there is also the graphic hallmark Cronenberg visuals of the human flesh, tissue and blood and several scenes involving close ups of needles being injected into skin. The lead, Caleb Landry Jones, gives an outstanding performance, especially physically as the disease progresses through his body. I highly recommend this one.
