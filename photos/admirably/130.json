Some of our favorite parts:<br /><br />&quot;On a road test that covered 260 miles, split about two-thirds highway and one-third local, a 2013 Mazda CX-5 we tested earlier this year returned a remarkable 33.1 miles per gallon.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;There&#39;s also likely a SkyActiv diesel version of the CX-5 coming next year or the year after. If Mazda&#39;s new diesel four-cylinder engine is proportionally as efficient as its gasoline engine is, we wonder if that might not be the first 40-mpg compact crossover on the market.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;...The fun begins when the &quot;Start&quot; button is pressed. Mazda was sufficiently confident in the CX-5&#39;s roadholding and handling, in fact, that it invited journalists to take the CX-5 around the notorious Laguna Seca racetrack during the press launch. The crossover acquitted itself admirably, with neutral, predictable handling, not that much body roll, and remarkably good electric power steering...&quot;<br /><br />&quot;We think that&#39;s a pretty compelling package. Well done, Mazda.&quot;", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z134wx2gduqgyzc5k04ci1d51rqfw3hgv0g/people/plusoners"}, "replies": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z134wx2gduqgyzc5k04ci1d51rqfw3hgv0g/comments"}, "id": "z13ddzihvqnhihskq22dtpe4xlu5cje2x", "objectType": "activity"}, "updated": "2012-07-13T18:09:08.484Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/113948562681630114931", "image": {"url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-5c8wnpTLxlE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAC0/fwJ8h3N903Y/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Hilton Head Mazda", "id": "113948562681630114931"}, "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "Public"}, "verb": "share", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/FXxlcXircM5woxDOHLeYQ9pgB8I\"", "published": "2012-07-13T18:09:08.484Z", "id": "z134wx2gduqgyzc5k04ci1d51rqfw3hgv0g"}, "NONE"]
