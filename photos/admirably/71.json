This low-slung black and white beast looked fast sitting still, and backed it up with precise handling and tire-melting power. The C10 took the podium in all five events, especially excelling in the autocross and slalom, where it earned ten points for two First-Place finishes. Despite not being the most powerful truck, its enormous sticky tires and Wilwood Ultralite brakes helped it take Fourth in the speed stop and Fifth in the quarter-mile. On top of all of this, its aggressive styling finished the job by adding more points in the show-and-shine. Brad&#39;s C10 pushes the limits of what a <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23truck\">#truck</a> can do, and for that reason, it&#39;s easy to see why it took home the gold", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 3, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12sjh1bao24sjzdu23ocxt5flu3tpt3g/people/plusoners"}, "replies": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12sjh1bao24sjzdu23ocxt5flu3tpt3g/comments"}, "objectType": "note"}, "updated": "2013-04-30T21:24:19.101Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/102726959030511113383", "image": {"url": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-fgyAxlAZ-Qk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABzQ/YNtL30y1uNA/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Truckin Magazine", "id": "102726959030511113383"}, "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "Public"}, "verb": "post", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/zjc_zoqHKnx4ixr1wm8EYSh3GKI\"", "published": "2013-04-30T21:24:19.101Z", "id": "z12sjh1bao24sjzdu23ocxt5flu3tpt3g"}, "NONE"]
