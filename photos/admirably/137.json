A Gary Fisher. I rode it in the canyons around LA and in the California desert and (with big fat slicks installed) commuted from Culver City to Santa Monica every day. It rode across the country on top of the car (along with Cathy&#39;s bike) and we had memorable rides in Kentucky, Tennessee, and New Mexico, among other places. The frame had to be replaced once early on, due to a parking lot encounter with a semi-trailer, but its wheels, components (and soul) were successfully transplanted. Twenty-two years later it&#39;s a museum piece, drawing disbelieving stares from the kids at the bike shop, but is still performing admirably.<br /><br />Yet I fell in love with the commuter bikes in Amsterdam. I dig the weight-be-damned attitude of Dutch bike commuters. (Of course, it&#39;s easier to damn the weight in an utterly level country like the Netherlands.) But I found myself longing for multiple racks for carrying parcels, fenders to keep that black line from running up the back of my shirt when it rains, a chain guard to protect my right pant leg, and a big heavy chain lock.<br /><br />Yet I couldn&#39;t bring myself to weigh my faithful Fisher down with all that stuff.<br /><br />My 57th birthday&#39;s on Derby Day and I started thinking about buying a commuter bike for rainy days or heavy loads, and keeping the Fisher carefree and unburdened.<br /><br />And I&#39;ve been dreaming for years about trying a low-maintenance alternative to bike chains. How I loathe bike chains. I love the idea of enclosed shaft drives, but couldn&#39;t find quite the right fit. So, instead, I&#39;m going with a belt drive and internal gearing. No oily mess! Very little maintenance. Ordered today. I&#39;ll let you know how it works out.", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12ggzmopwu3jnw4c04cfjxw0mqnureadj4/people/plusoners"}, "replies": {"totalItems": 3, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12ggzmopwu3jnw4c04cfjxw0mqnureadj4/comments"}, "objectType": "note"}, "updated": "2012-05-03T18:53:13.481Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/108594675742591733119", "image": {"url": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-0uot1FQ5bbM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAF4I/WtjGG0VAk6k/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Joseph Clay Thompson", "id": "108594675742591733119"}, "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "Public"}, "verb": "post", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/LKvX5djvqAvscizk4CyNfQ5msiQ\"", "published": "2012-05-03T18:53:13.481Z", "id": "z12ggzmopwu3jnw4c04cfjxw0mqnureadj4"}, {"items": [{"inReplyTo": [{"url": "https://plus.google.com/108594675742591733119/posts/Ptvyeuoef4j", "id": "z12ggzmopwu3jnw4c04cfjxw0mqnureadj4"}], "kind": "plus#comment", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 0}, "object": {"content": "oooh-- I look forward to future reports!", "objectType": "comment"}, "updated": "2012-05-03T20:36:49.006Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/112589467103369665954", "image": {"url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-LuaCwtC54ck/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACd4/o4Pqrx1SrTI/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Brenda Johnson", "id": "112589467103369665954"}, "verb": "post", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/4dtrgDXS2HtGSnANV_Qm8R1uvGA\"", "published": "2012-05-03T20:36:49.006Z", "id": "z12ggzmopwu3jnw4c04cfjxw0mqnureadj4.1336077409006105", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/comments/z12ggzmopwu3jnw4c04cfjxw0mqnureadj4#1336077409006105"}, {"inReplyTo": [{"url": "https://plus.google.com/108594675742591733119/posts/Ptvyeuoef4j", "id": "z12ggzmopwu3jnw4c04cfjxw0mqnureadj4"}], "kind": "plus#comment", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 0}, "object": {"content": "You are on the leading edge.", "objectType": "comment"}, "updated": "2012-05-03T21:34:51.319Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/111910200485959385328", "image": {"url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-mFCkXHqKX8c/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAD2w/mSb1q7ESn_I/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Norman Ma", "id": "111910200485959385328"}, "verb": "post", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/4hhdYcKOx84mtpweLOMbuswRe-Q\"", "published": "2012-05-03T21:34:51.319Z", "id": "z12ggzmopwu3jnw4c04cfjxw0mqnureadj4.1336080891319000", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/comments/z12ggzmopwu3jnw4c04cfjxw0mqnureadj4#1336080891319000"}, {"inReplyTo": [{"url": "https://plus.google.com/108594675742591733119/posts/Ptvyeuoef4j", "id": "z12ggzmopwu3jnw4c04cfjxw0mqnureadj4"}], "kind": "plus#comment", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 0}, "object": {"content": "Spot&#39;s out of stock in the frame size I need, so I won&#39;t have anything to report &#39;til the middle of June.
