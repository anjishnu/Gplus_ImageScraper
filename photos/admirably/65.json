I hit a bump, thought I had hit some debris and didn't give it much thought until I got home and noticed the light was missing. 8800+ miles and the clip broke. I replaced it with a Blackburn Mars 3.0 light which is considerably brighter and has two amber side LEDs. Battery life is a little worse, but, it runs on AAA batteries which are easy to find. I saw a few randos trying to buy CR2032s at convenience stores with no luck and the USB chargeable lights just don't have the duration.
