Read our statement here* (bottom of page)\u00a0<br />Facebook has long allowed content endorsing violence against women. They claim that these pages fall under the \u201chumor\u201d part of their guidelines, or are expressions of \u201cfree speech.\u201d But Facebook has proven willing to crack down on other forms of hate speech, including anti-Semitic, Islamophobic and homophobic speech, without claiming such exemptions.<br /><br />That\u2019s why we\u2019re calling on Facebook to make the only responsible decision and ban gender-based hate speech. Can you help?<br /><br />Below are prominent companies whose Facebook ads have appeared alongside violent, hateful content. Will you join us in asking them to stop advertising on Facebook until Facebook takes real action to end gender-based hate speech on its site?<br /><br />CAMPAIGN UPDATE: Over 60,000 tweets and over 5000 emails later, it worked! Read our statement here<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.womenactionmedia.org/facebookaction/\" class=\"ot-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.womenactionmedia.org/facebookaction/</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><b>STATEMENT</b> May 28, 2013\u00a0<br /><br />Last Tuesday, Women, Action &amp; the Media, the Everyday Sexism Project and author/activist Soraya Chemaly launched a campaign to call on Facebook to take concrete, effective action to end gender-based hate speech on its site. Since then, participants sent over 60,000 tweets and 5000 emails, and our coalition has grown to over 100 women\u2019s movement and social justice organizations.<br /><br />Today, we are pleased to announce that Facebook has responded with a important commitment to refine its approach to hate speech. Facebook has admirably done more than most other companies to address this topic in regards to content policy. In a statement released today, Facebook addressed our concerns and committed to evaluating and updating its policies, guidelines and practices relating to hate speech, improving training for its content moderators and increasing accountability for creators of misogynist content.<br /><br />Facebook has also invited Women, Action &amp; the Media, The Everyday Sexism Project and members of our coalition to contribute to these efforts and be part of an ongoing conversation. As part of these efforts, we will work closely with Facebook on the issue of how Community Standards around hate speech are evaluated and to ensure best practices represent the interests of our coalition.<br /><br />For details regarding Facebook\u2019s response, please visit here.<br /><br />Facebook has already been a leader on the internet in addressing hate speech on its service. We believe that this is the foundation for an effective working collaboration designed to confront gender-based hate speech effectively. Our mutual intent is to create safe spaces, both on and off-line. We see this as a vital and essential component to the valuable work that Facebook is doing to address cyber-bulling, harassment and real harm.<br /><br />\u201cIt is because Facebook has committed to having policies to address these issues that we felt it was necessary to take these actions and press for that commitment to fully recognize how the real world safety gap experienced by women globally is dynamically related to our online lives,\u201d explains Soraya Chemaly.<br /><br />\u201cWe have been inspired and moved beyond expression by the outpouring of energy, creativity and support for this campaign from communities, companies and individuals around the world. It is a testament to the strength of public feeling behind these issues.\u201d says Laura Bates, founder of the Everyday Sexism Project.<br /><br />Jaclyn Friedman, executive director of Women Action and the Media (WAM!), said: \u201cWe are reaching an international tipping point in attitudes towards rape and violence against women. We hope that this effort stands as a testament to the power of collaborative action.\u201d<br /><br />We are hopeful that this moment will mark an historic transition in relation to media and women\u2019s rights in which Facebook is acknowledged as a leader in fostering safer, genuinely inclusive online communities, setting industry precedents for others to follow.We look forward to collaborating with these communities on actions both big and small until we live in a world that\u2019s safe and just for women and girls, and for everyone.<br /><br /><br /><br />FacebookRSSTumblrTwitterPinterest<br />UPCOMING EVENTS<br /><br />\u2018After Tiller\u2019 Screening And Panel Discussion<br />11.6.2013, Washington, DC<br />WAM!NYC Book Club: Americanah, by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie<br />11.10.2013, New York City<br />WAM!
