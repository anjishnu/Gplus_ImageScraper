(I didn&#39;t see the 3D, because the glasses tend to give me a headache, and I didn&#39;t want that to affect my appreciation of the story.)<br /><br />I am happy to say that the film was incredibly faithful to the book. There were a lot of things about the way the story is told in the book that I thought might be abandoned, because there are things you&#39;ll accept in prose that just won&#39;t work in film. But is precisely those things that make the book so precious to me. Ang Le managed to conquer those hazards admirably, so I am content. In fact, I feel I understand what it&#39;s about even more clearly.<br /><br />It&#39;s hard to explain why this story touches me so deeply without risking spoiling it for people who haven&#39;t read or seen it, but I&#39;m planning to blog more about it later. I&#39;ll just say this for now: this is not a story about a boy and a tiger in a boat, or about survival against impossible odds. It&#39;s about stories, and the liminal space between rationality and faith.\u00a0", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z120id05uzj0ff3ym04cintiwvned1fyekw0k/people/plusoners"}, "replies": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z120id05uzj0ff3ym04cintiwvned1fyekw0k/comments"}, "objectType": "note"}, "updated": "2013-02-18T16:18:01.333Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/100734578636132354347", "image": {"url": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-VOTTN8UOonk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABNA/y0Y_BHpABPM/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Stace Dumoski", "id": "100734578636132354347"}, "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "Public"}, "verb": "post", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/dXXzCPeHaYf_1LpVF1R-tc68Mco\"", "published": "2013-02-18T16:18:01.333Z", "id": "z120id05uzj0ff3ym04cintiwvned1fyekw0k"}, "NONE"]
