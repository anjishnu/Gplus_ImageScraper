Nixon fell because of phone hacking (they called it bugging). Cameron\u2019s government barely survived Murdoch\u2019s phone hacking.

Even the Chinese are complaining that we\u2019re hacking them!\n\nWith regard to evil intent, this scandal is no worse than all the others. The distinction is in the scale of the thing. Whereas previous hackings were the technological equivalent of holding a water glass to the wall, this stuff is comprehensive and panoramic in scale. George Orwell would have cried tears of joy if he would have had this kind of creepy material at his disposal to fantasize about.

Because of the nasty risks he had to take, and I must say he has navigated them with admirable \u00e9lan, the extent of the enterprise is now well-known to everybody.\n\nAs is always the case, the government is claiming that the legitimacy of the operation is derived from national security, and it has demonstrated a handful of cases where terrorist acts have been thwarted by following up email interceptions. The problem is in setting the policy on who gets hacked. Where does it say that we need intelligence from spying on the presidents of Mexico and Brazil, to name two. More likely, the intelligence recovered was more commercial than criminal-related. The issue concerns the lack of oversight and supervision about who shouldn\u2019t be hacked. Basically, foreign governments that are friendly to us should have been excluded, as well as their citizens. They have their own cops, and don\u2019t need to be supervised by us. Obama has been absent from this process, and he needs to ensure that the policy is not determined in a mental or ethical vacuum.\n\nAny impeachment process instituted by Republicans would have to establish Obama\u2019s knowledge and complicity in the process, what he authorized or benefitted from. As the old saying goes, \u201cWhat did the President know, and when did he know it\u201d. If they could establish that he calculated any of his strategies based on unethical intelligence sources, they would have an issue that generates a lot of public interest. They could toast him with it.\n\nAll it requires is one spark to conflagrate, something the public can relate to, like the Milly Fowler case in Britain, which was totally sordid and revolting. If the Republicans hope to generate public opinion, they need a skillful investigator/promoter for digging up and exploiting an equivalent story about the NSA.\n\nObama has headed off the Republicans on this issue by appearing to move very aggressively to try to apprehend Snowden, though he allowed Snowden to slip through his fingers in Hong Kong, and it\u2019s interesting to speculate on whether or not that was intentional. If he had charged Snowden on the grounds of stealing intellectual property, which Hong Kong is very sensitive about, instead of a nebulous extradition request asserting national security, self-interest would have dictated that they send him back immediately. Ha-ha, maybe the complaint was inadequately composed by the same somnambulant bozos that have been formulating policy. Obama\u2019s administration has been making a lot of mistakes, but the Republicans have been too involved in chasing their own tails to identify them.\n\nObama deserves great recognition. After all, he won the Nobel Peace Prize about one week after assuming office, unless the Nobel Committee was delivering a broad slap at Bush, which was probably closer to the truth. He has always won because his opponents have been idiots.
