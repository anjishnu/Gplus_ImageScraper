Does she think Head Start teachers don't?\n\nIf you deprive hundreds of thousands of people of something they need, without giving them any say in the matter, then announce that you yourself are keeping that thing because you need it, you just might be an asshole. Of the congressional Republican variety, specifically. Some Republicans who voted to shut down the government, furloughing 800,000 federal workers, delaying paychecks even for the essential employees who are at work every day (like, say, Capitol police), and closing many needed government programs are now coming forward to explain why they won't be donating their paychecks to charity as others are doing. Take Rep. Renee Ellmers, Republican of North Carolina:\n\n\"I need my paycheck. That's the bottom line. I understand that there may be some other members who are deferring their paychecks, and I think that's admirable. I'm not in that position.\"\n\nOh, well, as long as you neeeed it, I'm sure that makes you very different from all the janitors and secretaries and accountants and Head Start teachers and workplace safety inspectors you voted to furlough without pay. Ellmers is, in fact, close to the bottom of the House wealth rankings. It probably would be uncomfortable for her to go without her paycheck! Which is where maybe she should think about all the people who make a fraction of what she's paid as a member of Congress, people who didn't get to vote, as she did, on taking their damn paychecks away.\n\n#ReneeEllmers \u00a0 #ASSHOLE \u00a0+Renee Ellmers\u00a0", "fullImage": {"url": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-MvOWq41PT-w/Ullmg_5D78I/AAAAAAABpMA/udma1lc1tU0/w550-h367/Renee_Ellmers%2Bbitch.jpg", "width": 550, "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 367}, "url": "https://plus.google.com/photos/113630612440279083293/albums/5933886696186504545/5933886701129953218", "image": {"url": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-MvOWq41PT-w/Ullmg_5D78I/AAAAAAABpMA/udma1lc1tU0/w506-h750/Renee_Ellmers%2Bbitch.jpg", "width": 506, "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 750}, "content": "Renee_Ellmers bitch.jpg", "id": "113630612440279083293.5933886701129953218", "objectType": "photo"}], "url": "https://plus.google.com/113630612440279083293/posts/PAQrsN3GRQD", "content": "<b>Republican who voted for shutdown: &#39;I need my paycheck.&#39; Does she think Head Start teachers don&#39;t?</b><br /><br /><b>If you deprive hundreds of thousands of people of something they need, without giving them any say in the matter, then announce that you yourself are keeping that thing because you need it, you just might be an asshole</b>.
