For this reason, I didn\u2019t have a good feeling about her. However, because she was one of my relatives, I had relations with her anyway. Day after day, her behavior became worse until our common friend, Hanieh, who was older than us and was a very kind and faithful person told me: \u201cI can\u2019t just stand and observe Zahra\u2019s decay and do nothing.\u201d\nFrom that time, Hanieh devoted herself to Zahra and became close to her so that she took her everywhere with herself. I never realized what happened to Zahra so that one day she came to the mosque and during the Religious Ceremony, told me that she had decided to wear a veil from the month of Moharam. I was surprised. After that, I heard that she broke up her friendship with that boy but I couldn\u2019t believe that she would put on veil.\nZahra put on a veil from that Moharam and changed gradually and after a while she was no more the same person as was before.\nA few years later something happened in my life that made me severely depressed. My father asked Zahra to accompany with me and pay more attention to me. I found Zahra treating me like what Hanieh did to her some years ago. Her deep sympathy and pure kindness towards me made us like sisters. We become so close to each other that one day I told her: \u201cDid you know that I hated you before and now I love you so much as if the pervious Zahra has gone and a new one is born?`\nOne day I figure out an interesting matter and told Zahra: \u201cDo you remember when you were a child, you became sick and were about to die? In that time, your uncle gave you blood (Zahra\u2019s uncle died a martyr some days later)? Be sure that the blood of a martyr flows in your vessels that caused you to change so much and become faithful.\u201d\nI noticed that she become so admirable. She really cared about her prayers such that once we were out and the prayer time reached and we were not in a situation to pray, she became so sad and cried and her tears flowed on her cheeks and just after she started praying, she got calm.\nHer belief was real and manifested in all of her life, Ethics and Conduct, appearance and Conscience. Finally she was married to a kind- hearted and believing man.\nAn interesting point in their life is their wonderful love towards each other which differentiates them from other partners. I think this intense love is because of their care about their relationship with passers. They are very committed to love.\nWhen I see them, I thank God a lot for my veil and understand that I should pay more attention to my behavior so that I don\u2019t waste whatever I can get from legitimate ways through illegitimate ways. I am sure God likes these gifts for all people but we miss these gifts because of inadvertency.
