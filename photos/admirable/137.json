It actually didn&#39;t happen to me- it happened to my sister but I was there to witness it. We were on our way to my Aunt\u2019s house and there were a few security checkups on the way and our vehicle was stopped.<br />An army officer asked for the identity cards of all the passengers on the vehicle. While he was checking, he asked for my sister\u2019s ID and after he noticed that she was a <b>Niqabi</b>, he put his hand over the place where my sister\u2019s photograph was. <b>SUBHAN&#39;ALLAH!</b><br /><br />What an amazing form of respect he displayed! I\u2019m absolutely certain that that officer wasn&#39;t a Muslim and to know that he respected the <b>Niqab</b> and more importantly- the *Niqabi*\u2026 It\u2019s really something worth saluting!<br /><br />To all those non-Muslims out there who respect our <b>Niqab</b>, we respect you! I pray that <b>ALLAH</b> guides them to the light of Islam and I make a sincere prayer here that for that amazing show of respect from that army officer, may <b>ALLAH</b> guide him to <b>Islam</b> and bless his life with goodness!<br /><br /><a href=\"http://niqablovers.blogspot.com/2013/01/a-salute-to-gentleman-admirable-niqab.html\" class=\"ot-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://niqablovers.blogspot.com/2013/01/a-salute-to-gentleman-admirable-niqab.html</a>", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 2, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12wyd2r1kmfe1llw22cf1xqso2igx2ii04/people/plusoners"}, "replies": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12wyd2r1kmfe1llw22cf1xqso2igx2ii04/comments"}, "id": "z13bxvcrvmmrcno3s23tfte5zv3yxpe2d", "objectType": "activity"}, "updated": "2013-09-17T13:29:48.400Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/117642502960269173929", "image": {"url": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-xCdqujyJPpI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAA1Q/14xB4C6vNKo/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Alfisha Sameer Ahmed", "id": "117642502960269173929"}, "annotation": "Masha allah very nice post", "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "Public"}, "verb": "share", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/h1D1ofIWJZwtPyurcQAfO6tw3ik\"", "published": "2013-09-17T13:29:48.400Z", "id": "z12wyd2r1kmfe1llw22cf1xqso2igx2ii04"}, "NONE"]
