More and more I fear that by the time Disney is done with Star Wars, there will be few admirable characteristics about it. I know the director, the producer, the writer, and whoever else is involved in it are very popular among the Disney movies, but this isn't originally a Disney movies series. I know some people think Star Trek and Star Wars are pretty much the same idea, but they sincerely are not. I'm sure J. J. Abrams can write a really good story that captivates his audience, but will this really good story match the aspects of all the other Star Wars movies? Can he effectively satisfy the expectations of every dedicated Star Wars fan? I know the answer to that question is no, so which fans will he satisfy? All I want is for it to match whatever timeframe he puts it in canonically. I understand that if it's based off a book, he will have to change the story a little bit to make it a thrilling movie, but I hope he can pick a story that he doesn't have to change too much!
