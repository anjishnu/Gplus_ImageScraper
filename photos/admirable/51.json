it's a very nice looking display.\n\nBattery is rated for about 5+ hours, but I've had it for 2 days, using it on and off without charging and it's still going.\n\nThe bootup time makes you go 'WOW!', literally every time you boot. \u00a0It's adding years to my life (vs waiting for Windows to boot). \u00a0The sleep mode is nice as well, just close the cover and go away, come back and open the screen and it automatically turns on. \u00a0One thing that isn't instantaneous is WiFi connection. \u00a0Takes about 10 seconds more for WiFi to hook up, but that's expected. \u00a0I think they shut it down during sleep mode to conserve the battery, which is a good thing.\n\nMy Chromebook is WiFi only, although they should be coming out with 3G/4G models as well (from what I read).\n\nI bought a sturdy carrying case for it, so it's well protected. \u00a0It doesn't way much (about 2.5 pounds), so pretty easy to carry.\n\nThe power supply is micro-USB standard, ie you can use your phone's charger most likely to charge both Chromebook and the phone. \u00a0That's what I do and works very well. \u00a0I haven't tried charging it from zero, to see how long it would take, since it hasn't run out of juice for me yet.\n\nIn terms of performance - I love the little guy. \u00a0Works fast enough for me, I don't really see any difference between my pretty fast laptop and this Chromebook. \u00a0It certainly keeps up with me pretty well, and does a very admirable job with multiple tabs open.\n\nI haven't tried the offline mode yet, but will at some point.\n\nThe sound on it isn't stellar, but certainly very usable and clear. \u00a0I just wish it had a bit more bass, but it's not bad at all.\n\nThe video quality is ok, certainly not as good as my desktop's camera, but perfectly adequate for Hangouts. \u00a0Microphone quality is also good.\n\nIn terms of external expandability - it has a couple of USB ports.\n\nIf you're looking for an inexpensive laptop-type device that's small and easy to carry, yet has a beautiful and very useful screen and keyboard and don't need to run Windows apps - this would be an excellent box for you. \u00a0Even if you did have some Windows apps on another computer - you could always connect remotely from Chromebook and get things done that way.\n\nI certainly would recommend this Chromebook from HP without hesitation.", "fullImage": {"url": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-BZo6dUSShzk/UnGjdaEharI/AAAAAAABWbc/ccMUka_7wvo/w526-h932/IMAG6306-MOTION.gif", "width": 526, "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 932}, "url": "https://plus.google.com/photos/105225758574529720824/albums/5940709106473530193/5940709109088217778", "image": {"url": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-BZo6dUSShzk/UnGjdaEharI/AAAAAAABWbc/ccMUka_7wvo/w506-h750/IMAG6306-MOTION.gif", "width": 506, "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 750}, "content": "IMAG6306-MOTION.gif", "id": "105225758574529720824.5940709109088217778", "objectType": "photo"}], "url": "https://plus.google.com/105225758574529720824/posts/Ub8XkPQ6M88", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/105225758574529720824", "image": {"url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XkCyqzYtihQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAABT40/AEQNNPUmbHg/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Oleg Moskalensky", "id": "105225758574529720824"}, "content": "<b>HP Chromebook review</b><br /><br />So, I&#39;ve had my shiny new Chromebook from HP for 2 days now and here&#39;s what I can tell you...<br /><br />It&#39;s a slick looking unit (I&#39;ll share some photos as soon as AutoBackup hurries up and gets them here). \u00a0It&#39;s well-built, keyboard feels decent to go at a pretty good clip. \u00a0Has a good feel to it.<br /><br />The screen is 11.6-inch, so it&#39;s not huge, but it isn&#39;t small either and with the resolution being what they have -
