After significant soul searching, I have decided to suspend operations. I wish that I could legally share with you the events that led to my decision. I cannot. I feel you deserve to know what\u2019s going on--the first amendment is supposed to guarantee me the freedom to speak out in situations like this.</i><br /><br /><i>Unfortunately, Congress has passed laws that say otherwise. As things currently stand, I cannot share my experiences over the last six weeks, even though I have twice made the appropriate requests.</i><br /><br /><b><i>This experience has taught me one very important lesson: without congressional action or a strong judicial precedent, I would _strongly</i> recommend against anyone trusting their private data to a company with physical ties to the United States._</b><br /><i>Sincerely,</i><br /><i>Ladar Levison</i><br /><i>Owner and Operator, Lavabit LLC</i><br /><br />see\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130808/13092724113/ed-snowdens-email-provider-lavabit-shuts-down-to-fight-us-govt-intrusion.shtml\" class=\"ot-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130808/13092724113/ed-snowdens-email-provider-lavabit-shuts-down-to-fight-us-govt-intrusion.shtml</a>", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z124jbibfuahfheui22dirigzyvqy3bvg/people/plusoners"}, "replies": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z124jbibfuahfheui22dirigzyvqy3bvg/comments"}, "id": "z13xyxgymxvfgnpps04cetehsvf0x3nbtmc0k", "objectType": "activity"}, "updated": "2013-08-09T04:18:56.173Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/105522890349749090750", "image": {"url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fhXA34MsUmk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAfJQ/9ucrUzL_PWw/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Jeremy Huehn", "id": "105522890349749090750"}, "annotation": "Admirable!", "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "Public"}, "verb": "share", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/K17ifgLt48HI_RxlaIrzv_Qgl8A\"", "published": "2013-08-09T04:18:56.173Z", "id": "z124jbibfuahfheui22dirigzyvqy3bvg"}, "NONE"]
