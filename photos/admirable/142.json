There\u2019s no question that the <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23Gospel\">#Gospel</a> has made an impact, but sometimes the change in the culture and attitudes is not as obvious.<br /><br />One of the major challenges facing Mission Aviation Fellowship (#MAF) is the departure of the vast majority of Western missionaries. Until the early 1990s, several Protestant denominations had hundreds of <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23missionaries\">#missionaries</a> in the DRC\u2013now it is only a small handful. This has brought dramatic change to the flight programs. MAF has had to adapt to these new realities and think creatively to address the needs of the country.<br /><br />A recent success for MAF is a partnership with the  <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23Mennonite\">#Mennonite</a>  Central Committee. Mennonite missionaries established hospitals and churches in several remote places, including Kajiji, Mukedi and Nyanga. After the missionaries left, one of the main challenges these hospitals have encountered is the lack of essential medicines and supplies. The Mennonite Central Committee arrived three years ago with a plan to provide an initial supply of essential medicines and training on how to manage income from the sale of these supplies, which was used to purchase and deliver the next batch. MAF has partnered with this project from the beginning.<br /><br />On a quarterly basis Dr. Gasphard, the Congolese doctor in charge of this program, rides his motorcycle over treacherous roads for 10 hours to the nearest major town and buys supplies. He is then met in Kikwit by an MAF  <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23Caravan\">#Caravan</a> , which then carries about 2000 pounds of medicines, Dr. Gasphard, and his motorcycle, and flies to the two remote hospitals.<br /><br />Dr. Gasphard\u2019s heart and tenacity are admirable. Four years ago, he lost his wife and baby in an accident on an Antonov 32 aircraft that lost an engine upon takeoff out of  <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23Kinshasa\">#Kinshasa</a> . He was quite nervous the first few times he flew with MAF, but now it has become more routine and he is very appreciative of MAF\u2019s partnership. Through his leadership, the medicine program is self-sufficient now. Each batch is sold and provides the money needed for the purchase and delivery of the following batch. He estimates the Nyanga and Mukedi mission hospitals serve a population of about 60,000. And so it is through faithful partners like Dr. Gasphard that MAF is able to follow Christ\u2019s example in showing compassion for the pressing physical and spiritual needs of the Congolese people.<br /><br />Learn more about the Pederson family: <a href=\"http://www.maf.org/pederson\" class=\"ot-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.maf.org/pederson</a><br /><br /> <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23newsletter\">#newsletter</a>  \u00a0  <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23enews\">#enews</a>  \u00a0  <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23enewsonline\">#enewsonline</a>  \u00a0  <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23newspaper\">#newspaper</a>  \u00a0  <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23enewssponsoredcontent\">#enewssponsoredcontent</a>  \u00a0", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 3, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13khrg5soqoybkjo04cf5xw2sy5zzzgljg/people/plusoners"}, "replies": {"totalItems": 1, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13khrg5soqoybkjo04cf5xw2sy5zzzgljg/comments"}, "objectType": "note"}, "updated": "2013-09-13T17:00:22.000Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/104527516142519561173", "image": {"url": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-k31vRg4bX1g/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACZY/faUIzL77FFg/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Mission Aviation Fellowship", "id": "104527516142519561173"}, "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "Public"}, "verb": "post", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/gaKRSJ6UxyjSxQUj6dqMWc0LbZQ\"", "published": "2013-09-13T16:51:00.686Z", "id": "z13khrg5soqoybkjo04cf5xw2sy5zzzgljg"}, {"items": [{"inReplyTo": [{"url": "https://plus.google.com/104527516142519561173/posts/hu6GhmbtDAF", "id": "z13khrg5soqoybkjo04cf5xw2sy5zzzgljg"}], "kind": "plus#comment", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 0}, "object": {"content": "Read more stories in the September edition of Boarding Pass:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.maf.org/bp/bp31\" class=\"ot-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.maf.org/bp/bp31</a>. \u00a0Sign up to have the Boarding Pass emailed to you every month:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.maf.org/news-and-resources/publications\" class=\"ot-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.maf.org/news-and-resources/publications</a>", "objectType": "comment"}, "updated": "2013-09-13T16:53:32.000Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/104527516142519561173", "image": {"url": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-k31vRg4bX1g/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACZY/faUIzL77FFg/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Mission Aviation Fellowship", "id": "104527516142519561173"}, "verb": "post", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/-jxm8Fzqu9yh28_fZczi2o7FP4w\"", "published": "2013-09-13T16:53:11.627Z", "id": "z13khrg5soqoybkjo04cf5xw2sy5zzzgljg.1379091191627697", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/comments/z13khrg5soqoybkjo04cf5xw2sy5zzzgljg#1379091191627697"}], "kind": "plus#commentFeed", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/AYyx-aTO4pknJAcHeFBcz1HMkBE\"", "title": "Google+ List of Comments for an Activity"}]
