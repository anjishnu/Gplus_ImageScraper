Member\n\nBio: Luna is no doubt a Ravenclaw. She\u2019s highly intelligent and unusually perceptive, although not a lot of people see past her unusual demeanor. She\u2019s quirky with a serene disposition, often sounding distant and dreamy as she will drift away from a conversation she doesn\u2019t find interesting. Luna is uncomfortably honest, lacking a self-consciousness and isn\u2019t afraid to show everyone who she really was. She is unphased in pressuring situations, almost never seen anxious or stressed. She likes to paint in her free time, raves about the Quibbler, and can often be seen skipping around the castle. Luna is extremely accepting of others and showed admirable bravery during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. She is a great friend once you get to know her and will not turn her back in a time of need.\n\nSecret/Objective: She is an active member of D.A. and will do anything to help her friends.\n\nFace Claim: Evanna Lynch", "fullImage": {"url": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Dsy0yS5aBtk/UkhO8Wt_GtI/AAAAAAAABuU/Djb7mJpIE6M/w500-h208/Patronus.gif", "width": 500, "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 208}, "url": "https://plus.google.com/photos/102977167446512248560/albums/5929075707941058017/5929075708230834898?sqi=111347873991486654943&sqsi=9ca61b8c-094f-48c6-83dd-360e21951b13", "image": {"url": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Dsy0yS5aBtk/UkhO8Wt_GtI/AAAAAAAABuU/Djb7mJpIE6M/w506-h750/Patronus.gif", "width": 506, "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 750}, "content": "Patronus.gif", "id": "102977167446512248560.5929075708230834898", "objectType": "photo"}], "url": "https://plus.google.com/102977167446512248560/posts/9fbiMYNK8XZ", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/102977167446512248560", "image": {"url": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-oNIOz2yNvMY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACf8/CQxZO1m0DFo/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Sam Parker", "id": "102977167446512248560"}, "content": "\u2727 Luna Lovegood \u2727 Ravenclaw \u2727 5th \u2727 Pure-blood \u2727 Open \u2727<br /><br />Position: D.A.
