revelation from God. \u00a0He was to become a missionary and take the word of God to the farthest flung reaches of thew world. \u00a0After some thought, he decided on Africa, and picked a small group of villages in one of the poorest areas. \u00a0So he got his shots, raised the money to travel from his generous friends and packed his new Bibles, small and leather-bound, also bought by the generosity of his friends and flock.\n\nIn the first village, he found two children starving. \u00a0Their parents were dead and they were just being raised on the street, collecting scraps of waste people had thrown out. \u00a0The preacher didn't know what to do, he reached into his bag to find one of the small, leather-bound Bibles he had brought with him. \u00a0But just as he was about to hand it to the small boy, he put it back, and reached into his other pocket and handed the child his last sandwich that he had packed for the flight.\n\nIn the second village, he found a family all infected with AIDS. \u00a0Even the children of the family, five of them, were cursed with the disease as it was passed onto them by their parents. \u00a0The father was clearly close to death, and so he reached into his bag for one of the small leather-bound Bibles. \u00a0At the last moment, though, he couldn't hand the man a Bible, so instead, reached into his other pocket and gave him the last of his money. \u00a0He helped the children fetch some clean water, and helped repair the window of their house.\n\nIn the third village, the man was almost destitute. \u00a0Suddenly a Toyota Hillux full of child soldiers roared into town. \u00a0As the children jumped down with teh AK-47s and extended 40-round magazines, he fled, and hid behind a small stack of bins. \u00a0He heard shots, firing, and eventually saw a few men dragged into the street and shot in the head. \u00a0Finally he saw some grown men walk into a far house and listened to the screams as they raped the women inside. \u00a0No longer able to bear it, he reached into his bag to find that one leather-bound Bible that he wanted to give to others, but had really saved for himself...\n\nUpon flicking through the Bible, he found that it contained no real help on close-quarters combat tactics or evasion techniques, nor did it really offer any help in terms of translating \"Please don't shoot\" into the local language. \u00a0Also, upon realizing the extent of the suffering around him, he concluded that no loving God could ever allow this and became an atheist. \u00a0Also, that the leather on the Bible covers was an act of animal cruelty and so vowed to become a vegan. \u00a0Also, in a final act of common sense, he ran off, located the nearest American embassy and got his ass out of the country and back home, where he embarked on a large money-raising exercise for multiple charities, including Water Aid and Doctors Without Borders, as he realized that the thousands of dollars he spent on travel arrangement and buying Bibles that didn't really help the situation would be best off in the hands of experts with existing infrastructure and contacts to make a difference. \u00a0Also, that in hindsight, having the Bibles in English in a place where literacy levels were low because of lack of access to good education was a kinda stupid idea.\n\nMost of you won't share this because you'd be bored to death by the end of the first paragraph, but share it if verbose, preachy, supposedly enlightening, anecdotal fiction annoys the fuck out of you too.", "fullImage": {"url":
