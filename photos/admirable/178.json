As people find it difficult to imagine the specific ways in which they will change in the future (due to the lack of a model/pattern to match), they easily assume that such changes are unlikely. In short, people may confuse the difficulty of imagining changes with their unlikelihood!<br /><br /><br />People tend to regard the present as the time when they have <i>finally</i> become the person they will be for the rest of their lives.<br /><br /><br /><b>What to do?</b><br /><br />An antidote to perceiving one&#39;s personality as attractive, one&#39;s values admirable, and one&#39;s preferences wise would be <b>humility</b>. There is a difference between appreciation of what one has achieved (including in terms of &#39;purification&#39;) and arrogance.<br />If, from past progress, one can build faith in one&#39;s abilities without denying one&#39;s remaining weaker points, future change can be confidently welcome.<br /><br />An antidote to the reification of oneself (knowing oneself &#39;well&#39;) is<br /><b>&quot;not knowing&quot;</b>. Stay interested in who you&#39;re becoming! Pay attention to changes. Subtle variations may make a lot of difference (e.g. when &#39;cooking&#39;) and they usually distinguish the true master from the bookish parrot. The antidote is to stay tuned in your emerging mastery!<br /><br />An antidote to regarding the present as the time when you have <i>finally</i> become the person you will be for the rest of your life is in shifting from a view of certainty to a view of <b>appreciation</b>. It is not in denying the current results of your journey so far\u2026 Appreciation is distinct from fixating things: you may appreciate the love of people around you, but projecting a certainty on it leads to complacency and taking it for granted! Similarly, you can appreciate your current life, but taking it for granted is unhelpful.<br /><br />An antidote to the pattern-matching dilemma is the famous <b>cessation of ignorance</b> of Buddhism: acknowledging that patterns do emerge, and have utility, but that they do not hold the predictive powers and certainties we project on them. This antidote sometimes manifests as a long journey to travel (gradual cultivation), sometimes in a flash (sudden insight)\u2026 Don&#39;t presume you know how or when you&#39;ll reach the goal of holy life.<br />Try to stay mindful of how you use patterns (every day, all day long): the best patterns are examples of &quot;conventional truth&quot; while the mindful awareness of their limitations (contextual-ness) is an example of &quot;ultimate truth&quot;. Every time you hold awareness of both, you&#39;re dropping the veils that seemed separating you from your buddha-nature.<br /><br /><br /> <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23Buddhism\">#Buddhism</a>  \u00a0<br />image: \u00a9\u00a0<span class=\"proflinkWrapper\"><span class=\"proflinkPrefix\">+</span><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/102924130113610853494\" class=\"proflink\" oid=\"102924130113610853494\">Adam Martinakis</a></span>, 2013<br />study: <a href=\"http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~dtg/Quoidbach%20et%20al%202013.pdf\" class=\"ot-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.wjh.harvard.edu/~dtg/Quoidbach%20et%20al%202013.pdf</a>", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 1, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13afbv4lpnhh1w2t221yxdbvvzxjldvr/people/plusoners"}, "replies": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13afbv4lpnhh1w2t221yxdbvvzxjldvr/comments"}, "id": "z12ghlo5uneihfroa04chb3xjkr0fxfaalc0k", "objectType": "activity"}, "updated": "2013-08-23T06:44:55.093Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/110221110505801391351", "image": {"url": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-cTL3Ghvcx_c/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAP48/RuHGaDe1TpQ/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Camille Key", "id": "110221110505801391351"}, "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "Public"}, "verb": "share", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/8Xhr53JSmswaPFzdw_08SnvBGqY\"", "published": "2013-08-23T06:44:55.093Z", "id": "z13afbv4lpnhh1w2t221yxdbvvzxjldvr"}, "NONE"]
