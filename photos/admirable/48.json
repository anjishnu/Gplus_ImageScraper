But as for my people, they have not come to know the judgment of God Almighty.\u201d\u00a0(Jeremiah 8:7)<br />.<br />With those words, the prophet Jeremiah sounded God&#39;s judgment against the apostate people of Judah, who had left their God and turned to the worship of foreign deities. (Jeremiah 7:18,31)<br />.<br />When reprimanding the apostate people of Judah who failed to discern the time of God&#39;s judgment, the prophet Jeremiah called their attention to the stork and other birds that \u2018well know their appointed times.\u2019 evidently refers to the seasonal arrival of migratory birds in his censuring the Israelite for not discerning the time of God\u2019s judgment on them.<br />.<br />To the Israelite, the stork, and especially the white stork, was a familiar sight as thousands of these birds pass through in the autumn and the spring following their migratory timetable and among those that \u201cobserve well the time of each one\u2019s coming in\u201d.<br />.<br />What we know about the stork? \u00a0<br />.<br />The Bible further pinpoint the storks activity.\u00a0<br />.<br />Where the birds themselves make nests, As for the stork, the juniper trees are its house. Psalms 104:17<br />.<br />Contrasting the flightless ostrich with the high-flying stork, God Almighty asked Job:\u00a0\u201cHas the wing of the female ostrich flapped joyously, or has she the pinions of a stork and the plumage?\u201d<br />(Job 39:13 )<br />.<br />The stork\u2019s pinions are of great breadth and power, the secondary and tertiary feathers being almost as long as the primaries, giving an immense surface to the wing and enabling the stork to be a bird of lofty and long-continued flight.\u00a0<br />.<br />A stork in flight soaring on its powerful wings, with its neck extended and its long legs stretched out straight behind it, makes an imposing sight. also with the rushing sound produced by the air passing through the stork\u2019s pinions. The primary feathers are fingered out in flight so that slots are formed at the ends of the wings, thereby controlling the airflow over the top of the wings and improving their lifting power.\u00a0<br />.<br />The stork is a large, long-legged wading bird similar to the ibis and heron. The white stork \u00a0(Ciconia ciconia) has white plumage except for the flight feathers of its wings, which are a glossy black. White storks breed in Northern Europe and winter in South Africa, making a round trip of 15,000 miles (24,000km).\u00a0<br />.<br />The Hebrew name for this large, long-legged wading bird is the feminine form of a word that means \u201cloyal one; one of loving-kindness.\u201d This is fitting, for unlike most other birds, male and female white storks remain paired for life. After wintering in warmer regions, most storks return year after year, often to the same nest that they have used before.<br />.<br />The stork\u2019s instinctive behavior illustrates the quality of loyalty in other remarkable ways.\u00a0Both male and female birds share in incubating the eggs and feeding the chicks.<br />.<br />\u00a0The book Our Magnificent Wildlife explains: \u201cAs parents, storks are exceptionally faithful.\u00a0A male stork in Germany flew into high-tension wires and was electrocuted. His mate continued to incubate the eggs alone for 3 days, during which she left the nest only once for a short time to look for food. In another case, when the female stork was shot, the father reared the young on it&#39;s own.<br />.<br />\u00a0What Can We Learn From The Stork Today?<br /><br />To many people today, loyalty and faithfulness are quaint ideas\u2014admirable but not practical.\u00a0<br />.<br />The proliferation of divorce, abandonment, embezzlement, and other forms of deceit demonstrates that loyalty is no longer valued.<br />.<br />In contrast, the Bible places a high value on loyalty that is motivated by love and kindness. It urges Christians to \u201cput on the new personality which was created according to God\u2019s will in true righteousness and loyalty.\u201d (Ephesian 4:24) Yes, the new personality helps us to be loyal, but we can also learn a lesson about loyalty from the stork.<br />.<br />Indeed, by instinctively showing faithfulness to its lifelong mate and tender care for its young, the stork lives up to the meaning of its name\u2014\u201cloyal one.\u201d Thus, storks served well as a powerful lesson to the unfaithful and wayward Israelite.<br />.<br />The Stork and Science, what has man studied?<br />.<br />Storks tend to use soaring, gliding flight, which conserves energy. Soaring requires thermal air currents. Ottomar Anschutz&#39;s famous 1884 album of photographs of storks inspired the design of Otto Lilienthal&#39;s experimental gliders of the late 19th century. Storks are heavy, with wide wingspans: the Marabou Stork, with a wingspan of 3.2m (10.5ft) and weight up to 8 kg (18 lbs), joins the Andean Condor in having the widest wingspan of all land birds.\u00a0<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />The Truth<br /><br />Please see video!<br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHuH7KaPbLc\" class=\"ot-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">BBC Earthflight (Winged Planet) - Common Cranes Fly Over Venice (Narrated by David Tennant)</a>", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12ctbwxlua4hncvz23eydx4nlqghnmeq/people/plusoners"}, "replies": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12ctbwxlua4hncvz23eydx4nlqghnmeq/comments"}, "id": "z13fzpizsmuthrl5a04chftbomiatlqides", "objectType": "activity"}, "updated": "2013-11-01T08:34:06.729Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/104699451308359350533", "image": {"url": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Spq1H8bKOMI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAB4/P4etJCUzbq4/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "The Truth", "id": "104699451308359350533"}, "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "Public"}, "verb": "share", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/jTYxu879456NpJHVsu5WlcB44n4\"", "published": "2013-11-01T08:34:06.729Z", "id": "z12ctbwxlua4hncvz23eydx4nlqghnmeq"}, "NONE"]
