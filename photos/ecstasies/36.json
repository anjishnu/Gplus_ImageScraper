De la Mare published several short books of short stories for children in the 1920s and 1930s, and the best of his tales were brought together in his <i>Collected Stories for Children.</i><br /><br />The English composer George Dyson (1883\u20131964) was inspired by the works of de la Mare to write his <i>Children&#39;s Suite after Walter de la Mare</i> The original title of this work, written in 1920, was <i>Won&#39;t You Look Out Of Your Window.</i> Dyson conducted a performance of this at the 1925 Proms.<br /><br />My classical music post for today is Part 1 of this Suite: I - Leggiero and II - Pastoral: Tranquillo.<br /><br />And here is the text of de la Mare&#39;s poem &quot;Music&quot;:<br /><br />When music sounds, gone is the earth I know, <br />And all her lovely things even lovelier grow; <br />Her flowers in vision flame, her forest trees <br />Lift burdened branches, stilled with ecstasies. <br /><br />When music sounds, out of the water rise <br />Naiads whose beauty dims my waking eyes, <br />Rapt in strange dreams burns each enchanted face, <br />With solemn echoing stirs their dwelling-place. <br /><br />When music sounds, all that I was I am <br />Ere to this haunt of brooding dust I came; <br />And from Time&#39;s woods break into distant song <br />The swift-winged hours, as I hasten along.", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 4, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12zvd5i3pn1x3wat04cc5aaqsi4crxhfdc/people/plusoners"}, "replies": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12zvd5i3pn1x3wat04cc5aaqsi4crxhfdc/comments"}, "objectType": "note"}, "updated": "2012-04-25T13:44:24.271Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/106660876363786203340", "image": {"url": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-InG-hvSCQNQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAQxI/41JNhH3QipE/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "\u2113aura \u2113awrie", "id": "106660876363786203340"}, "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "Public"}, "verb": "post", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/Qubw93JZK37uzxtbcF3A170SVDA\"", "published": "2012-04-25T13:44:24.271Z", "id": "z12zvd5i3pn1x3wat04cc5aaqsi4crxhfdc"}, "NONE"]
