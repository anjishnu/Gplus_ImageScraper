When breath ceases, he is suffused with an incomparable bliss. He realizes then that it is the storm of human breath that is responsible for the creation of the dream wave of the human body and its sensations; it is breath that causes body consciousness.<br /><br />St. Paul said\u00a0I protest by our rejoicing which I have in Christ  <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23jesus\">#jesus</a> \u00a0 our Lord, I  <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23die\">#die</a> \u00a0 daily.St. Paul was able by life-force control to dissolve the consciousness of his dream body into the everlasting rejoicing of the  <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23christ\">#christ</a> \u00a0 Consciousness.<br /><br />.<br />When with cessation of breath and the quieting of the heart the life force is switched off from the senses, the mind becomes detached and interiorized, able at last to perceive consciously the inner astral worlds and supernal spheres of divine consciousness.<br /><br />In the first stages of ecstasy ,We perceives the soul blessedness. By higher ecstasies that come as a result of complete mastery of the breathless state, he realizes the physical body to be made of life trons that are surrounded by a halo of grosser electroatomic cells,<br />We perceives the illusion of the body dream de materialize into the reality of God. By experiencing the reality of the body as prana or life trons, controlled by the thought of god , We \u00a0becomes one with Him. With that divine consciousness that we is able to create, preserve, or de materialize the dream atoms of his body or of any other object in creation.

Occasional use of the term Breathwork to describe Buddhist Anapanasati, \u201cmindfulness of breathing\u201d or &quot;conscious breathing&quot; appears to be misleading, because the meditator breathes naturally, without attempting to change the length or depth of the breath, simply observing it. This too can be debated as some practitioner would contend that whenever attention is focused and the object of attention changes, in this case breathing typically becomes longer, deeper and more relaxed<br>.<br>Breathing is the process that moves air in and out of the lungs Aerobic organisms \u00a0require oxygen to release energy via respiration, in the form of the metabolism of energy-rich molecules such as glucose. Breathing is only one process that delivers oxygen to where it is needed in the body and removes carbon dioxide. Another important process involves the movement of blood by the circulatory system. Gas exchange occurs in the pulmonary alveoli by passive diffusion of gases between the alveolar gas and the blood in lung capillaries. Once these dissolved gases are in the blood, the heart powers their flow around the body via the circulatory system. The medical term for normal relaxed breathing is eupnea.<br>In addition to removing carbon dioxide, breathing results in loss of water from the body. Exhaled air has a relative humidity of 100% because of water diffusing across the moist surface of breathing passages and alveoli.", "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "Public"}, "verb": "share", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/JEEV30lcYAPAsKrxbiGW8sr-HrQ\"", "published": "2013-08-31T16:24:08.257Z", "id": "z13bid5wzyagejcnd220zdlovkjuihxjq04"}, "NONE"]
