Sadly, God is not feared anymore and I believe that is why our country is in such a disastrous mess.<br /><br />There are many examples in the Bible about men collapsing to the ground unable to even look in the presence of God because of their deep fear of Him. \u00a0Even in the new Testament not just the old. \u00a0In Acts we see two people who were killed instantly by God for lying. This caused great fear in those who witnessed it. \u00a0Jesus lashed out in anger to the den of thieves working in His Fathers house of worship causing panic.<br /><br />When we experience the revelation of Christ our knowledge of God increases and we develop a deep respect, awe, and fear of the Lord. \u00a0The first instance of this fear was written about in the garden of Eden. \u00a0They feared God after they disobeyed Him. \u00a0Fear of God is essential to a persons relationship with Him. \u00a0It is not just being in awe of God but also a feeling of dread. \u00a0When we acknowledge how great and pure and righteous our Lord is and how impure and sinful and weak we are; it will not be hard to fear Him.<br /><br />God is love but He is also righteous, holy, and just. \u00a0We need to never forget that and should never be ashamed to speak of it. \u00a0To leave that part out is making a false god or idol of your own. \u00a0I believe if our country were to get the fear of God back into it there could be a much needed revival.<br /><br />Our faith in the powerful Almighty God living within us should never cause us to fear those false religions and their hateful false gods who are out to destroy God&#39;s people and rule the world. \u00a0God will never allow that to happen because His Kingdom trumps all others. In these last days I believe there will be an increase of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit for the glory of Christ who reigns in the heavens and among us today.<br /><br />I pray for all my beloved brothers and sisters in Christ always to put the fear of God before any worldly fear such as these foolish false gods, wicked religions, and wicked people doing evil acts to the innocent we see and hear about too often today. \u00a0The victory has already been won. \u00a0They can&#39;t touch our eternal promises and God will destroy them. \u00a0We are victorious over the enemy because of our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ who lives in us. \u00a0 AMEN!<br />~Lara Stang<br />October 24, 2013", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13asv2glmewtluoj04civ2ibrnryjozg3s/people/plusoners"}, "replies": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13asv2glmewtluoj04civ2ibrnryjozg3s/comments"}, "id": "z130stzh2vuodlqnp22lt5fjcvq4w5oan04", "objectType": "activity"}, "updated": "2013-10-25T03:25:08.834Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/100356535254562110603", "image": {"url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Ralph Smith", "id": "100356535254562110603"}, "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "Public"}, "verb": "share", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/P5F40HY5Sw53mK7nzkbxMJ2IT6g\"", "published": "2013-10-25T03:25:08.834Z", "id": "z13asv2glmewtluoj04civ2ibrnryjozg3s"}, "NONE"]
