Whose Son is he?<br /><br />ISLAM has already told the world what THEY think the answer is to this question! \u201cJesus NOT Son of God. He is A Prophet of ISLAM!\u201d Do you SEE and COMPREHEND THIS? &quot;...every spirit that CONFESSETH NOT that Jesus CHRIST [the Messiah; the Son] is come in the FLESH IS NOT OF GOD: and THIS IS THAT SPIRIT OF ANTICHRIST&quot; (1 John 4:3)!<br /><br />ISLAM, to your FACE, is calling the apostle Peter A LIAR, when Peter told Jesus, \u201c\u2026we BELIEVE and are SURE that thou art THAT CHRIST, THE SON OF THE LIVING GOD\u201d (John 6:69)! Islam\u2019s \u201cgod\u201d HAS NO SON!<br /><br />We know WHAT the followers of Islam THINK, but, the way YOU answer this question found in Matthew 22:42 will DETERMINE where YOU spend eternity \u2013 with God, OR in the Lake that BURNETH with fire and brimstone!<br /><br />The YOUNG PEOPLE (ages 10-50) of this generation are ALREADY in danger of their souls, being driven to MADNESS thanks to ORGANIZED RELIGION, which is immersed in their own HYPOCRISY, and their GREED FOR GAIN. Young people sit back and WATCH their parents and other adults \u201cGROVELLING IN ADMIRATION\u201d after these FALSE PREACHERS and TEACHERS!<br /><br />But, no matter WHAT the circumstances, EVERYONE IS RESPONSIBLE for their OWN SOUL! The SIN-question has been settled. Jesus settled it, once, for all, FOREVER, \u201cFor by ONE OFFERING he hath PERFECTED FOREVER them that are SANCTIFIED\u201d (Hebrews 10:14) by faith.<br /><br />Jesus was GOD IN FLESH, \u201c\u2026reconciling the world unto Himself\u201d (2 Cor. 5:19). Salvation has been BROUGHT DOWN to man and presented in Christ Jesus; but unless you THINK RIGHT about CHRIST, you CANNOT BE SAVED!<br /><br />Jesus told the religious leaders and the people of his day, \u201c\u2026IF YE BELIEVE NOT that I am HE [that is, CHRIST...], ye shall DIE IN YOUR SINS\u201d (John 8:24).<br /><br />Debate, discussion, controversy, and division FOLLOWS JESUS wherever he is preached, as surely as sunset follows the sunrise. To his disciples, Jesus said, \u201cTHINK NOT that I am come to SEND PEACE ON EARTH: I CAME NOT to send peace, but a SWORD.<br /><br />\u201cFor I am come to SET A MAN AT VARIANCE AGAINST his father, and the daughter AGAINST her mother, and the daughter in law AGAINST her mother in law.<br /><br />\u201cAnd a man\u2019s FOES shall be THEY of his OWN household\u201d (Matt. 10:34-36).<br /><br />Family members and friends are TORN APART because of the WORDS of the Son of God! But Jesus said, \u201cBlessed are ye, when MEN [male and female] shall SEPARATE YOU FROM THEIR COMPANY, and shall REPROACH YOU [to defame; to rail at; to chide; to taunt], and CAST OUT [to eject] your name as EVIL, for the Son of man\u2019s sake\u201d (Luke 6:22).<br /><br />Today, belief in CHRIST JESUS is dropping exceedingly, and RIGHTLY SO! After the church is GONE, the \u201cman of sin\u201d (2 Thes. 2:3) will reveal himself, and declare himself that he is \u201cGod.\u201d And the \u201cLIE\u201d that the world will believe, is that \u201cGOD HAS NO SON,\u201d therefore a MASS REJECTION of the gospel of Christ will take place, and &quot;...CAST DOWN THE TRUTH to the ground&quot; (Daniel 8:12)!\u00a0<br /><br />\u201cSEARCH THE SCRIPTURES; for IN THEM YE THINK YE have eternal life\u201d (John 5:39), but instead you are \u201cEVER LEARNING, and NEVER ABLE to come to the knowledge of the TRUTH\u201d (2 Tim. 3:7)!", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 1, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12nh3xr3qfaf5033235sbnzaq3ud3dlb/people/plusoners"}, "replies": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12nh3xr3qfaf5033235sbnzaq3ud3dlb/comments"}, "id": "z12bypnq0zemulktb22nczfhiru0zbc2n", "objectType": "activity"}, "updated": "2013-11-09T10:12:43.274Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/110020178455758982455", "image": {"url": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-BOZ5-aa8ACY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAgMY/XXMpH9lY8GQ/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "madhu gattineni", "id": "110020178455758982455"}, "annotation": "What think of ye Jesus Christ. Whatever you think.... He is God in Human form . He has done so many Miracle while He was on earth. He made the Dead to live, He got power over Death, Sin, devil , Diseases and  the Nature. He conquered Death .He is the wisest one and nobody spoke like him at any time.  His birth , Death and resurrection were predicted by Prophets well in advance before His Birth on this earth.What more qualities you need to prove somebody as God. Is there anybody equal to Him in living a sinless life ,Power to cure many diseases , performing Miracles, the message in Teachings at anytime. All these things prove that He is The Lord of all. He is far more above than any Prophet / messenger so far born on the surface of this earth. He is the true example and a role model that anybody can safely and happily  follow because he is pure, Sinless , Holy and very powerful.If we follow any human being who is sinful, unholy, we will end up in hell with Him. So Jesus is the one and only way for all the people in this world to follow and to enable them to go to Heaven.except Him there is no other way to go to Heaven and all others/ other ways lead us to Hell...  So Jesus is The Lord of all....
