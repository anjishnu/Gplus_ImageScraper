To get around that they spend a bit more time time on the problem to invent a trick. More than you but less than it would have taken them to manually add [1..3].

But you're not impressed cause you can add the numbers without even thinking.\n\nNow I ask you. What is 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 1000. You know a formula and quickly answer. The formula is clever and only a few people can come up with it from scratch. \u00a0Another person who doesn't know the formula not only answers but does so even more quickly.
