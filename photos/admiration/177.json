Through it all, he managed to find the inner strength to persevere.<br /><br />We knew Angelina Jolie was directing a film about the amazing life of World War II veteran \u2014 and former Olympic athlete \u2014 Louis Zamperini. Heck, we even knew he is still alive and kicking at the ripe old age of 96.<br />But now we know that Jolie has befriended the sage subject of her upcoming film, &quot;Unbroken.&quot; And, as a token of their mutual admiration, he has bestowed her with a good-luck charm: his golden running-shoe pendant, which he won during one of his earliest track races.<br /><br />Jolie lived near Zamperini in the Hollywood Hills during the development stages of the film. And she has vowed to wear Zamperini&#39;s golden running prize every day as she helms her first big-budget production in Australia in the coming months. The Universal film is scheduled to hit theaters on Christmas 2014.<br /><br />&quot;It will be hard to make a film worthy of this great man,&quot; the 38-year-old actress-director said in a statement today. &quot;I am deeply honored to have the chance and will do all I can to bring Louie&#39;s inspiring story to life.&quot;", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 2, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13ygfegpxjexhgvd22ag3nplzvqf1fgn04/people/plusoners"}, "replies": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13ygfegpxjexhgvd22ag3nplzvqf1fgn04/comments"}, "objectType": "note"}, "updated": "2013-10-10T23:29:21.000Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/115227724398149549982", "image": {"url": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Jim18qpPM7Y/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAnU/JDcWgTR3HsA/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Eunice Fields", "id": "115227724398149549982"}, "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "Public"}, "verb": "post", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/ZXgLXslI-jR_Q8bHRo4N880xdAI\"", "published": "2013-10-10T23:28:51.886Z", "id": "z13ygfegpxjexhgvd22ag3nplzvqf1fgn04"}, "NONE"]
