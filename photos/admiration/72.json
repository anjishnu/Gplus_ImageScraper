Annick screamed for me to stop, and being well versed in the ways of women, I stopped.\n\nThe small structure was a fabulous derelict with leaning and tilting doorways and windows. To add drama to the scene, the sky was putting on one of those displays of clouds, that you just can't stop looking at. The landscape surrounding the house was a wide open vista with distant, low lying mountains of granite. All in all, one of the most dramatic, but lonely landscapes I had seen in quite some time.\n\nI walked away thinking about the family that lived in this house. How courageous and resilient they had to be to survive in this place. To live in an environment where the nearest neighbor was miles away and to be challenged by year round extreme weather conditions. We cannot even begin to imagine hard and difficult life must have been for them, living as most of us live today. I left with a sense of admiration and respect for the life they chose to live out here.\n\nThis image was processed entirely in Lightroom 4 and Topaz B&W Effects 2.
