But not now. \u00a0Not anymore. \u00a0He was the GateKeeper. Charged with holding up the staff and keeping the gateway open. He was John Staffhand the last of his line. He stood firm.<br><br>His hand ached. John nearly shifted his feet to ease his discomfort. But keeping the Staff upright was the only thing that mattered. \u00a0Without it the gateway would close and they would all die.<br><br>Rocks were being drawn into the Gateway now. The power of the vortex growing stronger the longer it was open. \u00a0Scouring sand lashed at his back, finding his skin through the layers of clothing. \u00a0Supporting the Staff and staying upright was becoming difficult. \u00a0He would stand firm he was a Staffhand.\u00a0<br><br>\u201cStrange family\u201d the people would say, \u201cheard one of they say that bit of old wood can open a gateway between worlds\u201d. \u00a0Then the creatures had come through with their teeth of death destroying lives. His Grandmother had opened the first Gateway. The mocking had stopped.\u00a0<br><br>Her hair whipping wildly round her face, into her eyes, his Grandmother had held firm for three long hours during the first journey. She stood holding the unwavering Staff, while soldiers buckled and wept from the wind. \u00a0An entire country passed through that first gateway. The last soldiers had been blown through but the old woman stood firm.\u00a0<br>Protecting his eyes from the stinging sand, John looked back. Soldiers being chased by death were near .\u00a0<br><br>\u201cWe\u2019re the last, Gatekeeper,\u201d shouted the soldiers as they ran past.<br>It was time to jump.<br><br>John rammed the Staff into the hole he had created earlier. Slowly releasing his grip John kept his hand in place. \u00a0Ready to catch the Staff before it fell closing the gate and condemning John to the death that he could see bearing down on him.\u00a0<br><br>The staff held firm.<br><br>Carefully he began to pay out the line coiled around his belt, ensuring no tangles that would prematurely pull the staff free from its mooring and trap him.<br><br>\u201cNo snares now boy\u201d his grandmother always said.<br><br>Looking back in farewell John could see the teeth of death staring back. Had he left it too late?Time to run.\u00a0<br><br>Legs pumping. Heart pounding. Lungs bursting. Praying the Staff would hold just that little bit longer.<br><br>John leapt into blackness.\ufeff<br><br>###", "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "Writer's Discussion Group (Featured Posts)"}, "verb": "share", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/xKGK2lk9bubHbUiXHGXlZUiIBYg\"", "published": "2013-10-06T21:25:35.251Z", "id": "z12izjgrnnr2tdiiy04cebnrlzbvt1tge0k"}, {"items": [{"inReplyTo": [{"url": "https://plus.google.com/108131446424328262298/posts/eD1bnVhabsS", "id": "z12izjgrnnr2tdiiy04cebnrlzbvt1tge0k"}], "kind": "plus#comment", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 4}, "object": {"content": "Thank you.
