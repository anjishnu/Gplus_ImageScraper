I had a very special experience last Friday, November 1st. \u00a0I&#39;ll begin by saying that I don&#39;t care for drawing attention to myself or promoting myself in any way. \u00a0It&#39;s just not my style-- so please forgive me for this self indulgence. \u00a0However, I am compelled to share the following story because it really meant quite a lot to me. \u00a0<br /><br />David Braid (piano) and Phil Nimmons (clarinet) are two Juno award winning Canadian jazz musicians from the Toronto area that have been playing together for about ten years; in fact, Phil, who just turned 90 this year, was David&#39;s teacher. \u00a0Phil is often celebrated for being one of the most significant voices to have brought jazz to Canada (and sustaining interest in it). He ran a CBC radio show, has performed, and has been a teacher for many decades. When they choose to play together, every moment, every second, is improvised on the spot ... no two performances resemble each other.\u00a0<br /><br />Last year, David contacted me to use some images for a live recording they had done in 2010. \u00a0After looking for images in my collection, I just could not find ones that I felt organically fit the music, so I began to process new ones while listening to the live recording and ended up improvising a whole new approach to the tones and contrasts that I typically develop. \u00a0It was quite special. \u00a0David had a small booklet produced, about the size of a small 45 record. \u00a0I should add that I am an avid jazz fan. \u00a0<br /><br />That alone was enough to make me happy, but last Friday I was invited to take part in one of their performances in Ottawa (at the National Arts Centre). \u00a0They played their first set together, going back and forth between musical improvisations and question and answer sessions. \u00a0For the second set, David had his piano turned to the two screens on the stage and Phil turned his chair, and while I projected 120 of my images on to those two screens, they performed a solid, continuous sixty minute piece of improvisation inspired by looking at my long exposure seascapes and infrared landscapes. \u00a0I was enthralled by the music, so enthralled that my timing was off ... and, at times, I forgot to click through. \u00a0The music wound its way through melody and dissonance, structure and chaos, until, at one moment, the whole room was silent accept for Phil breathing through the clarinet, no notes, just breath ... near absolute silence, which, for me, is the very essence of what I try to communicate in my images. \u00a0 \u00a0After that set, the audience asked me to come up to answer some questions which, rather surprisingly, I handled quite comfortably. \u00a0<br /><br />It was an experience I will never forget. \u00a0And I have made two new dear friends. \u00a0In fact, all of the people who work at and run the National Arts Centre are exceptional human beings-- and several of them are new friends as well. \u00a0 I have loved Canada and its people since my first of many visits there over 25 years ago. \u00a0This experience solidified that admiration further.<br /><br />I took this image during the soundcheck. \u00a0Here&#39;s a link to the event if you want to read more about Phil and David&#39;s music: <a href=\"http://ottawajazzscene.ca/news/8519-phil-nimmons-and-david-braid-reinvent-their-music-with-each-concert\" class=\"ot-anchor\"

accept my apologies for making this post all about me. \u00a0\u00a0", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 42, "selfLink":
