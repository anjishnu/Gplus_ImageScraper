Here my contribution, a rather long passage from her biography written by\u00a0\u00c8ve Curie, her youngest daughter.\u00a0<br /><br /><i>&quot;The aversion which celebrity inspired in the Curies had still other sources besides their passion for work or their fright at the loss of time.</i>\u00a0<br /><i>With Pierre, who was naturally detached, the attack of popularity encountered resistance of principles ha had always held. He hated hierarchies and classifications. He found it absurd that there should be \u201cfirsts\u201d in a class, and the decorations which grown persons coveted seemed to him as superfluous as the medals awarded children in school. This attitude, which had made him refuse the Legion of Honour, was equally his in the realm of science. He was devoid of all spirit of competition, and in the \u201crace for discoveries\u201d he was able to endure being beaten by his colleagues without annoyance. \u201cWhat difference does it make if I didn\u2019t publish such and such work,\u201d ha had the habit of saying, \u201csince somebody else has published it?\u201d</i><br /><i>This almost inhuman indifference had had a deep influence on Marie. But when she fled before the evidences of admiration it was not in order to imitate her husband and not to obey him. The war against fame was not a principle with her: it was an instinct \u2013 an irresistible timidity, a painful shrinking congealed her as soon as curious glances were fastened upon her, and even provoked disturbances which brought on dizziness and physical discomfort.&quot;</i>\u00a0<br /><i>Also, her existence was too crowded with obligations for her to squander a single atom of energy uselessly. Carrying the full weight of her work, of her household, of motherhood and teaching all at once, Mme Curie advanced on her difficult road like an acrobat. Only one more \u201cpart\u201d to play, and the equilibrium was gone: she fell from the tight rope. Wife, mother, scientist, teacher, Marie had not one second of time available for playing the part of the celebrated woman.</i><br /><i>By differing routes, Pierre and Marie thus arrived at the same position. One might imagine that creatures who had accomplished a great work together might react to fame in different ways. Pierre might have been distant, Marie vain. \u2026 Nothing of the sort occurred. The two souls, like the two brains, were of equal quality. After all their trials the couple traversed this one too victoriously, and in their withdrawal from honours they remain united.&quot;</i><br />\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Eve Curie. \u00a0 <i>Madame Curie: A Biography</i><br />You can find the book online at\u00a0<br /><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/madamecurie035051mbp\" class=\"ot-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://archive.org/details/madamecurie035051mbp</a><br /><br />Image (PD in USA):<br />\t<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Marie_Curie.jpg\" class=\"ot-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Marie_Curie.jpg</a>\t<br />For more images ( some of them are copyrighted, so I&#39;m attaching the one in public domain) go to:<br /><a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1903/marie-curie-photo.html\" class=\"ot-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1903/marie-curie-photo.html</a>\t\t\t<br /><br />Have a good night!\u00a0", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 1, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13kv1aarpz4fbxig04ch1nguwfgddxqwhc/people/plusoners"}, "replies": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13kv1aarpz4fbxig04ch1nguwfgddxqwhc/comments"}, "id": "z12ofzsafxmlf5map04chdg4jzqlhdzxrjs", "objectType": "activity"}, "updated": "2013-11-08T05:44:12.187Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/116291599149679403926", "image": {"url": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ar2ZMGwtht4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAABcBc/ml2CmqO5RrM/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Joe Mendes", "id": "116291599149679403926"}, "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "Public"}, "verb": "share", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/I1zHs0x2g3F0t2SXAMWImaTCR6Y\"", "published": "2013-11-08T05:44:12.187Z", "id": "z13kv1aarpz4fbxig04ch1nguwfgddxqwhc"}, "NONE"]
