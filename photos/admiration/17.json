I would marvel at the unbelief of them; because they would daily see the manifestations of God and His love for them. For example, their clothing and shoes never wore out during this journey; the pillar of fire by night and the cloud by day for direction; the manna for food, provision of water in the desert, etc. As a baby saint I would say, &quot;I don&#39;t understand why they didn&#39;t trust God after all of the miracles they experienced in the wilderness.&quot; It goes back to &quot;judge not lest ye be judged.&quot; As I have been on my own wilderness journey for the pass 20 years, I found myself doubting God after countless miracles in my own life. After each miracle, the Holy Spirit would remind me of my judging the Israelites&#39; unbelief during their wilderness journey. I thought the above-mentioned passage a perfect example of that. I hope it strengthen everyone&#39;s FAITH who reads it as it did mine when I read it. LORD HELP MY UNBELIEF.
