The normally weekday tourist filled bustling streets were deserted. In less than twelve hours the place would be swarming. Fluorescent yellow tape would hang in the autumn breeze between light poles outside, serving as warning to an indignant community that the time of innocence was truly behind them.\u00a0<br>Savannah was known for its oak trees draped in Spanish moss and its southern hospitality; balmy afternoons sipping mint juleps not this public display of lawlessness.\u00a0<br>The town doctor was away, ironically on Jekyll Island getting back to nature and was not contactable; the nearest thing to a medical expert was the local dentist Dr Steve Price. Steve was unceremoniously escorted from his practice by the police chief whose face was bright red from the exertion of running half a block up the main street. Admittedly the events of this morning had taken him by surprise; well, shock was probably more apt a description and years of having nothing more serious than issuing an Out-of-Towner a moving violation was indicated by his belt which was labouring even at the nearest hole to the buckle. It could burst at any minute.\u00a0<br>As Steve was led to the surreal scene of the cordoned off frontage of the building, he was asked to don disposable blue shoe covers; latex gloves and a hair net. He moved past the Advertiser office on the right and continued to the barber shop that operated at the rear of the building. \u00a0<br>An assault to the senses is how he would describe it much, much later when he had time to reflect. His sense of smell and taste were the first to be activated as that sweet sickly metallic taste filled his nose and mouth. His tongue darted between his teeth and lips in some mad reptilian action trying to decipher his surroundings. A body laid on the barber shop floor, incredibly pale. He had only seen one dead body before and that was in medical school. He remembered that day because it was the day he had confirmed that he wanted to be in dentistry not in general practice or surgery. Dentists rarely had to deal with dead bodies, except for cases like today.\u00a0<br>Steve snapped his concentration back to the task at hand. He thought Okay! Describe clinically what you see. He knelt next to the body and instinctively placed his second and third fingers over the man\u2019s wrist and felt for a pulse, he recoiled in an instant. He had felt the slightest pressure through his fingers. He grabbed the No 4 dental mirror from his shirt pocket and held it up to the man\u2019s nose, it fogged up. \u201cHey, this guy\u2019s not dead\u201d He yelled. \u201cGet an ambulance\u201d. \u00a0Steve searched and found the leak site, a gash about 1 inch long in his thigh.\u00a0<br>He applied pressure for all that it was worth and prayed they were not too late. \u00a0<br>The Advertiser article praised Steve for his quick thinking and skill in a front page banner headline \u201cThe Price of Life!\u201d \u00a0Savannahs own Dr Steve Price saved the life of Billy, the barbers assistant, who conscientiously thought he was doing the right thing by sharpening the barbers cutthroat using the strop and slipped cutting his leg and subsequently fainting hitting his head on the ornate steel footrest of the chair which ensured he was knocked out. After a blood transfusion, Billy was recovering nicely mainly thanks to being brought back from the dead by the skin of his teeth as it were.", "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "Writer's Discussion Group (Featured Posts)"}, "verb": "share", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/JyaERRPCFn8yZi0Xf3Te-OEFTLI\"", "published": "2013-11-04T01:03:50.272Z", "id": "z12fs3nxprusgxera04ccftbvpu3vnfbrig"}, {"items": [{"inReplyTo": [{"url": "https://plus.google.com/111988562939724791550/posts/fXX2gp8k42i", "id": "z12fs3nxprusgxera04ccftbvpu3vnfbrig"}], "kind": "plus#comment", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 1}, "object": {"content": "Great, very engaging story.", "objectType": "comment"}, "updated": "2013-11-04T02:12:31.404Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/106135955420615071473", "image": {"url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ybHf2uYLU1g/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAHc/_n4RZBp2OWc/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Lisa Lewis, MD", "id": "106135955420615071473"}, "verb": "post", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/7LVSTPg7bxC_PeQQ3Ajk-xrGXNE\"", "published": "2013-11-04T02:12:31.404Z", "id": "z12fs3nxprusgxera04ccftbvpu3vnfbrig.1383531151404369", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/comments/z12fs3nxprusgxera04ccftbvpu3vnfbrig#1383531151404369"}, {"inReplyTo": [{"url": "https://plus.google.com/111988562939724791550/posts/fXX2gp8k42i", "id": "z12fs3nxprusgxera04ccftbvpu3vnfbrig"}], "kind": "plus#comment", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 1}, "object": {"content": "I liked the style.", "objectType": "comment"}, "updated": "2013-11-04T07:10:09.578Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/113070343896146676886", "image": {"url": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Yl56e1EMWDo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABk/CrMOSuco0IU/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "K M Idamari", "id": "113070343896146676886"}, "verb": "post", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/-c_os8_8x04s50E8evLOnw8t0uk\"", "published": "2013-11-04T07:10:09.578Z", "id": "z12fs3nxprusgxera04ccftbvpu3vnfbrig.1383549009578023", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/comments/z12fs3nxprusgxera04ccftbvpu3vnfbrig#1383549009578023"}, {"inReplyTo": [{"url": "https://plus.google.com/111988562939724791550/posts/fXX2gp8k42i", "id": "z12fs3nxprusgxera04ccftbvpu3vnfbrig"}], "kind": "plus#comment", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 0}, "object": {"content": "Where is this building?", "objectType": "comment"}, "updated": "2013-11-07T08:52:44.481Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/117403890201738587481", "image": {"url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Roger Regor", "id": "117403890201738587481"}, "verb": "post", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/8zszUTLFx6tWD4RtbUsY7Nub470\"", "published": "2013-11-07T08:52:44.481Z", "id": "z12fs3nxprusgxera04ccftbvpu3vnfbrig.1383814364481562", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/comments/z12fs3nxprusgxera04ccftbvpu3vnfbrig#1383814364481562"}, {"inReplyTo": [{"url": "https://plus.google.com/111988562939724791550/posts/fXX2gp8k42i", "id": "z12fs3nxprusgxera04ccftbvpu3vnfbrig"}], "kind": "plus#comment", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 0}, "object": {"content": "<span class=\"proflinkWrapper\"><span class=\"proflinkPrefix\">+</span><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/117403890201738587481\" class=\"proflink\" oid=\"117403890201738587481\">Roger Regor</a></span> Missouri.
