I feel that on this forum, I have moved in down the street next to all the worlds\u2019 knowledge, and all I need do, is knock on the door of my virtual neighbor, and ask a question.<br /><br />Google then records both question and answer, so that it might provide value to someone else over the Internet.<br /><br />In short, what Google has done, is create a living, breathing Think-Tank, with all of our minds, thoughts and identities on call for the needs of others 24/7. \u00a0By first insisting, and later only encouraging each of us to use our true identities, we have been massaged into (most of the time) putting forth our best, most thoughtful, and responsible selves.<br /><br />The resulting admiration from the ability to link provided information to its provider is measured in authority, measured in personal brand value.\u00a0<br /><br />Yes, I am the prototype Google fan boy. \u00a0I am so, because I strongly feel that Google is shrinking the world. \u00a0I spent my 30\u2019s and 40\u2019s on airplanes, and been all over this planet, with all of the associated stresses, expenses, and time considerations. \u00a0What used to take weeks of planning in the 90s and thousands of dollars is now accomplished with an invitation and a Hangout. It just blows my mind.\u00a0<br /><br />Every single day, I speak on the phone with people in other countries, completely free of charge, after connecting our network and our office phones to Google Voice. I am truly a kid in a technology candy store. We have the power today, through Google and Google+ to discover and connect with what truly interests and enlightens us. \u00a0We connect with others in a completely organic way.<br /><br />The two thousand people that I circle on Google+ are to me like a bag of candy that I reach into for the information I want, and the only cost, is participation. I cannot stress enough the importance of what Google and Google+ mean to our futures. It is the basis of the technologies that will end borders, and barriers to life based upon locations.<br /><br />Having been recently introduced to the minutia involved in living in one country while working in another; the rules, the restrictions, and the processes, I&#39;ve become enamored with the idea of a border-less world. \u00a0<br /><br />This is because borders are not what they once were; a kind of defining line between cultures and societies. We now live in a world where for most of us, our physical location is no longer relevant in our lives. If I want NY Bagels and Lox for breakfast tomorrow in Southern California, I can have it in 2 minutes and about 5 clicks on my laptop. (Yes, I\u2019ve done it)<br /><br />The concept of borders is an endangered species. The great news is that as these walls come down, so does the concept of persons defined solely by their cultures, rather than through their own individual interests. \u00a0Information needs to flow freely and woe to any society that seeks to limit information for its own interests, be it in the east or the west.\u00a0<br /><br />I mentioned that curiosity disorder? Well, Google even made it possible for me to find the one woman who suffers from the very same disease. \u00a0No, I am not suggesting that everyone can find the person of their dreams through Google, but I sure did. \u00a0Me; a Jamaican-Indian-American Navy Brat from SoCal, her a Chinese-Canadian from Kuala Lumpur. Yeah, I know, it happens every day, right? \u00a0<br /><br />More than any other company I can think of, Google is responsible for the walls between cultures and communities coming down. \u00a0<br /><br />None of our worlds will ever be the same.\u00a0<br /><br />For that reason, you can call me a Google Fan Boy.\u00a0", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 7, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z134uh4hvlmxxx50123wtnejpoftshmzb04/people/plusoners"}, "replies": {"totalItems": 1, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z134uh4hvlmxxx50123wtnejpoftshmzb04/comments"}, "id": "z12qgzphgye3szn0u23vulg42or5wh1vn", "objectType": "activity"}, "updated": "2013-11-06T09:08:16.000Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/109731558771429177320", "image": {"url": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-vnm9rJWvER8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAL-Q/GvHitSuFv2g/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Catherine Wakeling", "id": "109731558771429177320"}, "annotation": "<b>Via <span class=\"proflinkWrapper\"><span class=\"proflinkPrefix\">+</span><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/110828451332512395315\" class=\"proflink\" oid=\"110828451332512395315\">Bobbie Today</a></span>\u00a0- the Birthday Girl! xx</b><br><i>HAPPIEST OF DAYS TO YOU!</i><br><br>It would also have been <b>+J C Kendall&#39;s</b> \u00a051st Birthday today - shared alongside\u00a0<span class=\"proflinkWrapper\"><span class=\"proflinkPrefix\">+</span><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/110828451332512395315\" class=\"proflink\" oid=\"110828451332512395315\">Bobbie Today</a></span>, one of the most beautiful plussers I know, inside and out, that made me so welcome last year when I joined the G+ World.<br><br><i>Although I did not interact with him, the posts I read after his passing showed what a popular G plusser he was.</i>\u00a0<br><i>I just thought y&#39;all should at least read one of his posts...</i>", "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "Public"}, "verb": "share", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/bRhyzKnHENw55-kGiusTVkS8ORw\"", "published": "2013-11-06T09:07:28.296Z", "id": "z134uh4hvlmxxx50123wtnejpoftshmzb04"}, {"items": [{"inReplyTo": [{"url": "https://plus.google.com/109731558771429177320/posts/1CGqPi3ADqJ", "id": "z134uh4hvlmxxx50123wtnejpoftshmzb04"}], "kind": "plus#comment", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 0}, "object": {"content": "RIP;-}", "objectType": "comment"}, "updated": "2013-11-06T09:18:58.569Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/109914808454204378104", "image": {"url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-m3WF5EYQHXs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABa4/MVbGdH8Humw/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Lee Samuels", "id": "109914808454204378104"}, "verb": "post", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/qUiajX6eUKvinjNNix580_2Zeak\"", "published": "2013-11-06T09:18:58.569Z", "id": "z134uh4hvlmxxx50123wtnejpoftshmzb04.1383729538569224", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/comments/z134uh4hvlmxxx50123wtnejpoftshmzb04#1383729538569224"}], "kind": "plus#commentFeed", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/wiHIDxmJ_Sy8B1lbyXx_SIPWISg\"", "title": "Google+ List of Comments for an Activity"}]
