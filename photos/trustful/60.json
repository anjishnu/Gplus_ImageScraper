Oxytocin promotes non-personalistic attributions in response to a trust betrayal</b><br /><br /><i>&#39;..As predicted, OT strengthened the relationship between angry rumination about the event and nonpersonalistic attribution of the opponents\u2019 behavior and weakened the link between angry rumination and personalistic attribution..&#39;</i><br /><br />Recent research revealed that the neuropeptide Oxytocin (OT) increases and maintains trustful behavior, even towards interaction partners that have proven to be untrustworthy.<br /><br />However, the cognitive mechanisms behind this effect are unclear. In the present paper, we propose that OT might boost trust through the link between angry rumination and the use of non-personalistic and personalistic attributions.<br /><br />Non-personalistic attributions put the blame for the betrayal on the perpetrator&#39;s situation, whereas personalistic attributions blame his dispositions for the event.<br /><br />We predict that OT changes attribution processes in favor of non-personalistic ones and thereby boosts subsequent trust. Participants played a classic trust game in which the opponent systematically betrayed their trust.<br /><br />Critically, non-personalistic attribution also mediated the interactive effect of OT and angry rumination on how strongly investments were reduced in the remaining rounds of the trust game.<br /><br />In summary, the present findings suggest that one underlying cognitive mechanism behind OT-induced trust might relate to how negative emotions evoked by a breach of trust influence the subsequent attributional analysis: OT seems to augment trust by fostering the interpretation of untrustworthy behavior as caused by non-personal factors.<br /><br /><b>- Johannes Klackl, Michaela Pfundmair, Dmitrij Agroskin, Eva Jonas</b>", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 1, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z132sbca5mm1y54pt04cjvtyvmfdv12bqmk0k/people/plusoners"}, "replies": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z132sbca5mm1y54pt04cjvtyvmfdv12bqmk0k/comments"}, "id": "z12ispdb0warslfjh04cgdprqxztxpvhoek", "objectType": "activity"}, "updated": "2013-02-21T06:07:21.598Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/103345537240570767200", "image": {"url": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-My83xSFB5T8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAKnk/ARIx5iGFUSw/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Jackie Bohe", "id": "103345537240570767200"}, "annotation": "<span class=\"proflinkWrapper\"><span class=\"proflinkPrefix\">+</span><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/101901013133388625113\" class=\"proflink\" oid=\"101901013133388625113\">andrei tourubaroff</a></span> ", "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "Public"}, "verb": "share", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/jUew3YgZR5A7gJeR5mW-3s2wgc0\"", "published": "2013-02-21T06:07:21.598Z", "id": "z132sbca5mm1y54pt04cjvtyvmfdv12bqmk0k"}, "NONE"]
