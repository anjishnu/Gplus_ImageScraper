I came to the Crimean capital to meet him. When our eyes met, we recognized each other at once, and he gave me a very tender hug. We both had a feeling that we knew each other for a long time. When we came to Feodosia, I tried to show Jorge as many beautiful places as possible. I wanted to make his stay in my town nice and comfortable. We were travelling and at the same time, we were talking and getting to know each other. He turned out to be a very kind, easy going and nice person. He charmed me with his look on life and upbringing.<br /><br />Valentina and Jorge<br />He told me many funny stories making me laugh all the time. All our trips were pleasant and funny. And our dinners were romantic and unforgettable. I knew many things about Jorge&#39;s background, and the more I knew about him, the more I was impressed with him. He told me that he also liked me even more than in correspondence. It was an honor for me to meet his expectations. Together we visited Yalta, palaces in Crimea, ancient places in Feodosia, extinct volcano Kara-Dag. Jorge was impressed with the beauty of our places. Unfortunately, Jorge could not stay for a very long time.<br /><br />Valentina and Jorge<br />However, several days we spent together were enough to know that this man is a very unique, interesting, kind, generous, trustful and charming person. I do hope that we meet again for longer time, to be able to get to know each other even more than this time. I am waiting for Jorge&#39;s letters and our next meeting.\u00a0", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13mwphbvrenu3qwp04cj5chyt2jzlgj43w/people/plusoners"}, "replies": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13mwphbvrenu3qwp04cj5chyt2jzlgj43w/comments"}, "objectType": "note"}, "updated": "2013-09-20T01:44:16.024Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/103367065620072946887", "image": {"url": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-P0vDr9PnIi0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADU/Ctsfd2iy6FE/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Gregory Vasquez", "id": "103367065620072946887"}, "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "Public"}, "verb": "post", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/d81Ek2u3-ViC45D6hJooHADHtrM\"", "published": "2013-09-20T01:44:16.024Z", "id": "z13mwphbvrenu3qwp04cj5chyt2jzlgj43w"}, "NONE"]
