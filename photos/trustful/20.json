The sorrow which clutches at my soul has driven me to You my protector, my True Friend in time of need. You know, my God, all my failings, my faults and my sins as well as the torment gripping my soul. My greatest sorrow should be for my disregard of Your holy commandments in the past, and I sincerely hope that you will grant me the grace of true contrition. O my Savior, hide not Your Face from me in this tribulation, let the light of Your Countenance shine upon me that I may be illuminated by Its love. If it be Your will, lighten this burden from me, yet should it be a means of my salvation, help me, help me O Lord, to carry this cross, for alone I can do nothing. Radiate Your love upon Your prodigal child O Lord, this beggar who knocks at Your door seeking shelter in Your Sacred Heart; this once proud earthen vessel made of clay seeks You, O Christ, and in a newly found faith, firmly believes that you will receive him in Your limitless Love and Mercy. Amen<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Dear Lord, by allowing me to experience this affliction, so that I may share in your suffering on the cross for sin, you take a sublime chance that I might either draw closer to you for comfort, or turn away from you in my misery. O my Savior, grant me that precious grace to offer up my pain, as you did in Your Passion, to atone for sin. Help me to imitate your patience and to turn my complaints into offerings for my sins or for those of others, as you see fit. In this time of distress and pain, I ask, I seek, and I knock, for the grace of endurance, perseverance, and above all, trustful submission to Your Divine will, for my good and your glory.", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 7, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13iu1pw5pmktlug004cdrb52lj3dn5h3sg0k/people/plusoners"}, "replies": {"totalItems": 1, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13iu1pw5pmktlug004cdrb52lj3dn5h3sg0k/comments"}, "objectType": "note"}, "updated": "2013-09-13T22:41:05.389Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/105850826513216413908", "image": {"url": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-jYiMqdrnytQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAY4/otJNTo9RYEE/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Felismina Novais", "id": "105850826513216413908"}, "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "Public"}, "verb": "post", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/WfxvXqsudb8718oPWsR-D92d2j8\"", "published": "2013-09-13T22:41:05.389Z", "id": "z13iu1pw5pmktlug004cdrb52lj3dn5h3sg0k"}, {"items": [{"inReplyTo": [{"url": "https://plus.google.com/105850826513216413908/posts/NYjW1tn9zDr", "id": "z13iu1pw5pmktlug004cdrb52lj3dn5h3sg0k"}], "kind": "plus#comment", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 0}, "object": {"content": "Amen. .", "objectType": "comment"}, "updated": "2013-09-14T03:32:59.053Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/102363096927714741358", "image": {"url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ilWXCGez4kg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACQg/hJAdG5TAljE/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "genoveva Laput", "id": "102363096927714741358"}, "verb": "post", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/JtJrUh8SO0JZMbwr-YQ4YB_tx48\"", "published": "2013-09-14T03:32:59.053Z", "id": "z13iu1pw5pmktlug004cdrb52lj3dn5h3sg0k.1379129579053714", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/comments/z13iu1pw5pmktlug004cdrb52lj3dn5h3sg0k#1379129579053714"}], "kind": "plus#commentFeed", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/6ytuGGBfHNzpQKgP4r0V23ipdDA\"", "title": "Google+ List of Comments for an Activity"}]
