Limiting the company&#39;s market to one country and not being able to properly communicate with foreign clients is a path which most of times leads to poor year-end results.<br /><br />Learning a new language is a step towards<br /><br />A)\ta better understanding of our own - our mother tongue will always be the foundation of other learned languages<br /><br />B)\ta better articulated communication - a recently studied grammar will do wonders to one&#39;s ability to be clear and perfectly understood<br /><br />C)\tan open door to new business opportunities overseas<br /><br />D)\tcustomer loyalty - taking the time and effort to learn and speak to foreign clients in their own mother tongue makes them feel more at ease and trustful with the foreign company.\u00a0<br /><br />E)\tyou are clearly a problem-solver by not letting the language be a business barrier.<br /><br />A clear communication with all customers turns a company into a trusted one.
