However, she will only do this as a last resort. She actually prefers not to have her Pokemon fight unless they want to. She is very quirky and intelligent, and loves to talk and make friends. She can also understand Pokemon in their own language.<br /><b>Pokemon Bios:</b><br />Jetta the Gardevoir: I met Jetta when she was first a Ralts. I was exploring in a dark, rocky cave with Ember (Charmeleon) and I found her shivering from the cold. At first, she didn&#39;t trust me because she had a previous, abusive trainer, but she grew to be one of my most trustful partners. She is very gentle and elegant, and hates arguments.<br /><br />Toxica the Roserade: I met her quite recently as a Roselia. She was trying to steal food from a trainer, who fought her with his Grovyle and Pikachu, who she knocked out. I saw this from nearby, and to prevent her from further harm, I claimed her as my own Pokemon to fool the Trainer. Ever since then, Toxica has always told me she owed me. She is fast and feisty, and loves to battle. She often gets in arguments with Ember.<br /><br />Zen the Metagross: When exploring an ancient temple, Zen was one of the Bronzong who leapt out to attack me for coming. However, after I rescued the temple from the plans of Team Magma, Zen took and liking to me and helped me escape from the angry Magma members. He is very peaceful, stern and fatherly.<br /><br />Ember the Charmeleon: Ember was a gift from my human father, who wanted me to have a normal life as a Pokemon trainer. Ember was given to me as a Charmeleon, and he has stubbornly refused to evolve since then. As my first Pokemon, he and I have been on many adventures together. He is hot-tempered and rash, and sometimes a little bit too violent.<br /><br />Zip the Ninjask: Zip was originally a Nincada, hatched from an Egg that my mother found on a forest floor, abandoned and neglected. It took a long time for the egg to hatch, and I nearly gave up on raising it, considering it as a Bad Egg. When Zip did hatch, I was actually surprised, but I quickly got over it and trained Zip into the Ninjask he is today. He is extremely fast, witty, and a bit scatterbrained.<br /><br />Nuevo the Ninetails: She was the mother of 10 Vulpix and struggled to raise all her babies, so I journeyed with her to see my mom, who was used to bringing up small children. Nuevo was so overjoyed that she offered to become part of my team. She only speaks Spanish, but understands and will obey English commands. She is laid back and relaxed, but easily stressed.<br />(Is all this okay?)", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 6, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12ajflo5vyxslpw204ccpnb4xefeb5apu00k/people/plusoners"}, "replies": {"totalItems": 9, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12ajflo5vyxslpw204ccpnb4xefeb5apu00k/comments"}, "objectType": "note"}, "updated": "2013-09-12T01:47:35.342Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/101047246451089857756", "image": {"url": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-HiN7_wL2Ulc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAIgo/QEqJS7NMiRU/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Jadyn Silver", "id": "101047246451089857756"}, "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "The Pok\u00e9mon World RP (Profil\u00e9)"}, "verb": "post", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/CTPoe2XEH1nshlQYMUUk3PpCCWM\"", "published": "2013-09-12T01:47:35.342Z", "id": "z12ajflo5vyxslpw204ccpnb4xefeb5apu00k"}, {"items": [{"inReplyTo": [{"url": "https://plus.google.com/101047246451089857756/posts/NrmBHXxjuVd", "id": "z12ajflo5vyxslpw204ccpnb4xefeb5apu00k"}], "kind": "plus#comment", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 0}, "object": {"content": "Hai Jaydn~<br />Anyways...
