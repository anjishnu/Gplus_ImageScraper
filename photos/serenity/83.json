There was no one camping there that night, and the whole location was very peaceful. The cool breeze hit my face as I pressed the shutter, with such a great view of the milky way, who could complain?\u00a0<br /><br />This photograph is a vertical panorama of 6 images to create the wide perspective. The images were overlapping at least by 50%. A few minor adjustments were made including color correction, noise reduction, and contrast to give the Milky Way more pop. I also had to go in and touch up areas around the trees and the lake.<br /><br />There are two minor things I should cover in the photograph&#39;s description. The first is the foreground lighting. The ambient lighting was created solely from a nearby lamp post. The second thing to cover is the reflection on the water. You might be asking yourself, &quot;There are stars in the sky, why are they not reflected in the lake.&quot; It&#39;s a great question and it all has to do with the calmness of the water. On this night there was a great deal of wind and that caused the water to be a bit rough, thus removing the glass reflections.\u00a0<br /><br />I hope you all enjoy viewing the image as much as I did shooting it. :)<br /><br />500PX: <a href=\"http://500px.com/photo/42691828\" class=\"ot-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://500px.com/photo/42691828</a><br /><br />To see more please visit:<br /><a href=\"http://www.shainblumphoto.com\" class=\"ot-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.shainblumphoto.com</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.milkywayphotos.com\" class=\"ot-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.milkywayphotos.com</a><br /><br />EXIF: 20SEC F/2.8 ISO3200<br />Canon6D, Sigma 20MM<br /><br /><a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23astrophotography\">#astrophotography</a> <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23moon\">#moon</a> <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23galaxy\">#galaxy</a> <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23astronomy\">#astronomy</a> <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23stars\">#stars</a> <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23nature\">#nature</a> <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23landscape\">#landscape</a> <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23lake\">#lake</a> <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23cuyamaca\">#cuyamaca</a> <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23photography\">#photography</a>", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13lwtxhdyvegt4af04cgzbjnlyrczagu1k/people/plusoners"}, "replies": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13lwtxhdyvegt4af04cgzbjnlyrczagu1k/comments"}, "id": "z13zfxva0qrxh5li104cfvgaslrihzczev40k", "objectType": "activity"}, "updated": "2013-11-03T14:03:33.733Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/110268927010920891118", "image": {"url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-DSJ18qrdK6w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAWQ/NNNABN3UFTQ/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Ananya Datta", "id": "110268927010920891118"}, "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "Public"}, "verb": "share", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/EDZ7-0BzebqU-2IHaTwDvJ9hwRQ\"", "published": "2013-11-03T14:03:33.733Z", "id": "z13lwtxhdyvegt4af04cgzbjnlyrczagu1k"}, "NONE"]
