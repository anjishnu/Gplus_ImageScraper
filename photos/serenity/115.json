A sukkhavipassaka or vipassanayanika is one who takes up the Vipassana meditation without prior attainment of the mundane serenity absorptions.\n\nIn Sayadaw U Pandita's metaphor these 2 types both meet on a boad bridge at a lake. This shore represents the world of dukkha while the other shore is nibbana, the realm of supramundane peace. There are 2 ways to cross the lake: either swim or take a motor boat. The vipassana yanika immediately dives into the water and starts swimming. Since it is not an easy task to cross this sea of suffering it takes a long time and is rather\u00a0 exhausting. But a big advantage is, that right from the start he gets closer to nibbana - stroke by stroke.\n\nThe second way is taking a speed boat, this is the way of the samatha yanika. This is comparatively quick and easy. But the catch is, there is no boat at the boat bridge. The samatha yanika needs to build the boat himself. And building a Jhana-boat is for most people not an easy task. Some will never be able to build it.\n\nAnd sometimes the swimmer has already reached the other shore before the other has even finished building his boat. And although attaining the jhana is a very, very wholesome and skillful act, it does not necessarily get you closer to the other shore. The way to nibbana is to be reached through the insight knowledges (vipassana nana). And these can only be used by practicing vipassana meditation using non-conceptual objects, like the body, feeling, mind etc.\n\nThis metaphor links perfectly with the Asubha Sutta ( http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.163.than.html\n) with its 4 modes of practice:\n\n1. painful practice with slow intuition,\n2. painful practice with quick intuition,\n3. pleasant practice with slow intuition and\n4. pleasant practice with quick intuition.\n\nWhich path do you take?\n\n#buddhism #meditation #vipassana #samatha #jhana", "fullImage": {"url": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ol44NSJZ4AM/UnTEijKRyvI/AAAAAAAAFQo/Pm73us_7PBw/w2048-h1536/myanmar-yangon-ngahtatgyi-2013-000%2B%25285%2529.JPG", "width": 2048, "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 1536}, "url": "https://plus.google.com/photos/102884994977080446261/albums/5941589907034945921/5941589906241473266", "image": {"url": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ol44NSJZ4AM/UnTEijKRyvI/AAAAAAAAFQo/Pm73us_7PBw/w506-h750/myanmar-yangon-ngahtatgyi-2013-000%2B%25285%2529.JPG", "width": 506, "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 750}, "content": "myanmar-yangon-ngahtatgyi-2013-000 (5).JPG", "id": "102884994977080446261.5941589906241473266", "objectType": "photo"}], "url": "https://plus.google.com/102884994977080446261/posts/NM1RMzCTS88", "content": "<b>Samatha, Vipassana and how to cross a lake</b><br /><i>by Florian Scheidemantel</i><br /><br />Sayadaw U Pandita, one of Mahasi Sayadaws most well-known students, uses the analogy of different ways to cross a lake to teach us about samatha (serenity) and vipassana (insight) .<br /><br />A samatha yanika is a Yogi, who first develops one or all of the mundane serenity absorptions (lokiya samatha jhana) using a conceptual meditation object before beginning his Vipassana practice.
