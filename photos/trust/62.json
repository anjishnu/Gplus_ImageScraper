This is one of the key elements upon which relationships are built. For a relationship to be successful, both parties must trust the other. You can't go through life wondering what the other person is doing. You can't live in each other's pockets all day every day and must allow each other to have your own space, friends and past-times, but you need to strike a healthy balance between the two. Ensure the time you do spend together is eventful and quality time. This will stop either of you from becoming bored and you will look forward to the time you can spend together as a couple.\n\nOnce the trust is lost, it is very unlikely to return and therefore \"A relationship without trust is like a car without gas (petrol), you can stay in it all you want, but it won't go anywhere\".\n\nSometimes when the trust has gone, either or both partners are reluctant to end the relationship. Couples become very dependent upon each other particularly financially. They have joint bank accounts, take out joint mortgages, buy cars and take out credit agreements in joint names. Couples therefore sometimes stay together as this is the easiest option but isn't necessarily the best one.\n\nDo you need help with your relationship?
