Trust each other. You may find it hard in life and think that it is impossible to keep your best friend happy. To be a good best friend really doesn&#39;t take much. All you have to do really is make sure you can both trust each other about really important matters. Don&#39;t try to trick or use your friend to your advantage; you need to make them know they can trust you.<br /><br />2. Be trustworthy. If they tell you a secret, make sure to keep it. Never tell someone a secret your friend wanted you to keep. Don&#39;t even leak it out to someone you know you can trust. A secret is a secret.<br /><br />3. Be loyal. Stick up for your friend when they need it. Respect those times when they need to stick up for themselves. Trust your friend and allow yourself to be vulnerable with them. Through ups, downs, and disagreements, you&#39;ll still try to work things out and be their friend, truly demonstrating your loyalty.<br /><br />4. When you two fight, try to work things out so everyone is happy. Don&#39;t say mean things, whether it is right in their face or through a text. Apologize, but understand that it may take some time to get over what&#39;s happened. Let them cool down and talk to you when they are ready.<br /><br />5. Come through in the clutch. When your friend really needs something done, or a favor, be there for them. Help out. Think of how much they&#39;d appreciate it. You never know when you&#39;ll be stuck between a rock and a hard place and might need someone (a good friend, maybe?) to bail you out.", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 1, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12vjdoi2nmyghn4504cjzzipqn2tbxr5gc/people/plusoners"}, "replies": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12vjdoi2nmyghn4504cjzzipqn2tbxr5gc/comments"}, "id": "z12deforaxevu5rmg23sdf5xoxm1zlhdy", "objectType": "activity"}, "updated": "2013-11-07T06:49:45.553Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/102837659816792043606", "image": {"url": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-vXuj2s8olLU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAE4/62CbLZNsHcw/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Met Kuaro", "id": "102837659816792043606"}, "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "Public"}, "verb": "share", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/hrwmOK7Mxw4Nv6UWppZAE1DPCNo\"", "published": "2013-11-07T06:49:45.553Z", "id": "z12vjdoi2nmyghn4504cjzzipqn2tbxr5gc"}, "NONE"]
