However, some security challenges still exist in a few parts.\u201d\u00a0<br />~ President Goodluck Jonathan<br /><br />&quot;The people should be rewarded for peaceful conduct during the last six months. The National Assembly should make proper investigation based on the true situation on ground before taking any decision, both the president and the law makers should be mindful of the fact that they have taken oath of office to serve the people&quot;<br />~ Governor Murtala Nyako of Adamawa State<br /><br />&quot;Currently, many of the attacks on innocent people in the North-east take place in broad day light on the highways. Unless these measures are taken with the \u2018fierce urgency of now\u2019, an extension of emergency rule for another six months will simply amount to motion without movement.&quot;<br />~ Governor Ibrahim Geidam of Yobe State<br /><br />&quot;The extension if and when granted by the parliament would take effect from November 12, 2013, meaning that if approved it will terminate on May 11, 2014 thereby making it exactly one year&quot;<br />~ Daily Trust report<br /><br />&quot;I don\u2019t mind the extension because Madagali is on the border with Borno. Sambisa forest where the things are happening extends to Madagali, so these insurgents may take their activities further especially during the dry season.&quot;<br />~ Hon. Ahmad Fintiri, Speaker of Adamawa State House of Assembly<br /><br />\u201cOur situation would have been much more disastrous if not for the emergence of the civilian JTF made up of Borno youth who emerged at a point in time when the security agencies appeared helpless to put the out the insurgency. The civilian JTF is a product of desperation on the part of the youth and we thank Allah for their coming to up the challenge of the Boko Haram,<br />~ Dr. Bulama Mali Gubio, for Borno Elders<br /><br />&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />*Should FG extend emergency rule in Yobe, Adamawa and Borno states?<br />*Has emergency rule been efefctive, achieved the expected results?<br />*How would you rate the security personnel deployed to Yobe, Adamawa and Borno states?<br />*If emergency rule is ended, can the states solely provide security for the citizens?<br />*Would insurgents not have an upper hand in the absence of military prsonel?<br />*Way forward...?<br /><br /><br />READ MORE<br />EXTENSION OF EMERGENCY RULE WON\u2019T YIELD RESULTS UNLESS... \u2013 GEIDAM: <a href=\"http://dailytrust.info/index.php/news/9587-extension-of-emergency-rule-won-t-yield-results-unless-geidam\" class=\"ot-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://dailytrust.info/index.php/news/9587-extension-of-emergency-rule-won-t-yield-results-unless-geidam</a><br />SENATE APPROVES EXTENSION OF EMERGENCY RULE IN ADAMAWA, OTHERS: <a href=\"http://dailytrust.info/index.php/news/9588-senate-approves-extension-of-emergency-rule-in-adamawa-others\" class=\"ot-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://dailytrust.info/index.php/news/9588-senate-approves-extension-of-emergency-rule-in-adamawa-others</a><br />ADAMAWA REJECTS EMERGENCY RULE EXTENSION: <a href=\"http://dailytrust.info/index.php/top-stories/9494-adamawa-rejects-emergency-rule-extension\" class=\"ot-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://dailytrust.info/index.php/top-stories/9494-adamawa-rejects-emergency-rule-extension</a><br />JONATHAN SEEKS EXTENSION OF EMERGENCY RULE IN THREE STATES: <a href=\"http://dailytrust.info/index.php/news/9496-jonathan-seeks-extension-of-emergency-rule-in-three-states\" class=\"ot-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://dailytrust.info/index.php/news/9496-jonathan-seeks-extension-of-emergency-rule-in-three-states</a><br />...BORNO ELDERS DISAGREE WITH JONATHAN OVER EXTENSION: <a href=\"http://dailytrust.info/index.php/news/9495-borno-elders-disagree-with-jonathan-over-extension\" class=\"ot-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://dailytrust.info/index.php/news/9495-borno-elders-disagree-with-jonathan-over-extension</a><br /><br />&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />Let&#39;s Talk Nigerians...<br /><br />You can tweet your opinion via  <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23DailyTrustLTN\">#DailyTrustLTN</a>  on Twitter<br /><br />Please keep comments mature, tolerant and respectful.
