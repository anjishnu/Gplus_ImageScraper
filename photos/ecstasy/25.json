It is only when \u201cthe me\u201d in all subtle forms comes to an end that there is a state of bliss which cannot be sought after, an ecstasy, a real joy without pain, without corruption...\u00a0<br /><br />...When the mind goes beyond the thought of \u201cthe me,\u201d the experiencer, the observer, the thinker, then there is a possibility of a happiness that is incorruptible. That happiness cannot be permanent, in the sense in which we use that word. But, our mind is seeking permanent happiness, something that will last, that will continue. That very desire for continuity is corruption...\u00a0<br /><br />...If we can understand the process of life without condemning, without saying it is right or wrong, then, I think, there comes a creative happiness which is not \u201cyours\u201d or \u201cmine.\u201d That creative happiness is like sunshine. If you want to keep the sunshine to yourself, it is no longer the clear, warm life-giving sun. Similarly, if you want happiness because you are suffering, or because you have lost somebody, or because you have not been successful, then that is merely a reaction. But when the mind can go beyond, then there is a happiness that is not of the mind.\u00a0\u00a0<br /><br />- Krishnamurti", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12ij30iysv0dxnx004cclybwqzedf3bdqk0k/people/plusoners"}, "replies": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12ij30iysv0dxnx004cclybwqzedf3bdqk0k/comments"}, "id": "z13jwxkbetb5snwnn22gdlirvkzsubfu3", "objectType": "activity"}, "updated": "2013-11-04T05:29:46.948Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/114026719322544149401", "image": {"url": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-tR99Ib7Azzw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAALdw/SubceNW8kRc/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Tim Gruskovak", "id": "114026719322544149401"}, "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "Public"}, "verb": "share", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/e8n9xXn2DMP6p1wcpKYavWqDp2I\"", "published": "2013-11-04T05:29:46.948Z", "id": "z12ij30iysv0dxnx004cclybwqzedf3bdqk0k"}, "NONE"]
