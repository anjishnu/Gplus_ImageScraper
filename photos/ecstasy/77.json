I began drinking at an early age and alcohol quickly became the only thing that could set me free from my feelings. For so long I had felt like I didn\u2019t belong & drinking provided me with what I thought was endless popularity, friends, and re-assurance.\n\nMy life became out of control when I entered high school and started to drink more frequently. Alcohol was the only thing on my mind at the time and with a license in hand I began putting everyone in danger every time I hit the road. I was involved in many accidents involving alcohol and lost my license multiple times for driving offenses.\n\nAt the age of 18 I moved away from home (Prince Albert, Saskatchewan) to go to university in Edmonton, Alberta. While at a club one night my so called friends drugged me with ecstasy thinking it would help me relax. I was instantly hooked on the feeling that it gave me. I began taking ecstasy on a regular basis and drinking 3-5 times a week. Soon enough I was being introduced to different drugs; ketamine, cocaine, speed, GHB, inhalants and more.\n\nI barely made it through my first year of university, skimming by right above academic probation. I dropped out going into my second year without my parent\u2019s knowledge and began to work part-time while spending $40,000 in student loans. By this time I was using almost daily, drinking alone in my bedroom, destroying good relationships and entering into ones that were toxic and abusive. No one knew the pain I was in. I would put on an act that I was okay, but the truth is I wasn\u2019t.\n\nOne night, in a drunken blackout, I asked my parents for help.\n\nAARC was a new beginning to life. They taught me things about myself that I had buried for so long and showed me a set of steps that have helped me live my life selflessly in sobriety. Above all, they gave me hope and a sense of belonging that I had never felt without drugs and alcohol.\n\nThe accomplishments I have achieved in this past year since my graduation on September 8, 2012 are beyond anything I could have imagined. I re-entered the University of Lethbridge majoring in both accounting and finance, received honorary status on the Dean\u2019s List and multiple scholarships at year-end. Last April I was honored to have competed in the 2013 International CrossFit Games with over 200,000 other athletes. In the following months I trained for and completed a 20km Tough Mudder obstacle course, a 5km Spartan Race Sprint obstacle course and a 15km Super Spartan Race. Most recently, I have received offers to work for some of the most prestigious accounting firms in Canada. I truly believe that none of this would have been possible without the help of AARC, their staff and the continued dedication they show towards their clients and graduates.\n\nMy life today is amazing. AARC guided me to become a productive member of society and a better person to everyone around me. My ability to be honest is freeing and my life is something to be grateful for in every moment. My relationships with my family and friends are a blessing. My future is bright, but I believe it is contingent on what I do for today. I don\u2019t know for sure what it will hold but I do know that if I do what I need to right now, in this moment, things WILL work out.", "fullImage": {"url": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ltN2v15MWPw/Um8P-4fpZyI/AAAAAAAAAUU/DZ0T8DLOvFc/w480-h480/13%2B-%2B1", "width": 480, "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 480}, "url": "https://plus.google.com/photos/101152591450189433384/albums/5939984005250295457/5939984006516401954?sqi=111032273882109835316&sqsi=49664b8c-e4ae-40e0-8ccf-27089fac145c", "image": {"url": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ltN2v15MWPw/Um8P-4fpZyI/AAAAAAAAAUU/DZ0T8DLOvFc/w506-h750/13%2B-%2B1", "width": 506, "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 750}, "content": "10/28/13 - 1", "id": "101152591450189433384.5939984006516401954", "objectType": "photo"}], "url": "https://plus.google.com/101152591450189433384/posts/jZfQG3gUrFj", "content": "Brett L.<br />Graduate # 490<br />Honourary Graduate Milestones: Deans List, Multiple Scholarships, Spartan Race Sprint, Super Spartan Race, CrossFit Games and Tough Mudder<br /><br />The life I was living before coming to AARC was chaotic.
