There was much happiness all around in the abode of the Lord. The light of the lamps, the sound of the bhajans and the energy from the devotees\u2019 ecstasy were filling the air. With Tamburi in one hand and cymbals or chipla in the other, the great tapasvini was singing ecstatically with her Gopala smiling in front of her closed eyes. Meera stood up and danced with her song \u2018Mere Janama Maran ke sathee\u2019, and when the song ended, Kumbha gently approached her and requested her to come back. Meera said, \u2018Ranaji, the body is yours and you are a great devotee, but my mind, emotions and the soul are all His. I do not know what use I am to you in this state of mind\u2019.\u00a0<br /><br /><br /><br />Kumbha was moved and he started singing with her in unison. Meera rose up abruptly, stumbled and fell at the flowers on the feet of Giridhari. \u2018Oh, Giridhari, are you calling me, I am coming\u2019. Whilst Kumbha and the rest were watching in awe, there was a flash of lightning which enveloped Meera and the sanctum doors closed on their own. When the doors opened again, only Meera\u2019s saree was enveloping Shri Krishna\u2019s idol and her voice and the flute accompaniment were the only sounds that could be heard.<br /><br /><br /><br />It is said that in her death she melted into the heart of Krishna. Shri Krishna appeared in his subtle form and was so pleased with his dearest devotee that He opened up his heart centre and Sant Mirabai entered leaving her body whilst in the highest state of Krishna consciousness.<br /><br /><br /><br />So many princesses and queens have come and gone. So many princesses and queens have appeared on the stage of this world and vanished. How is it that the queen of Chittor alone is still remembered? Is this on account of her beauty? Is this on account of her poetic skill? No. It is on account of her renunciation, single-minded devotion to Shri Krishna and the self-realization she attained.\u00a0<br /><br /><br /><br />She conversed with Krishna. She ate with Krishna, her Beloved. She drank the Krishna-premarasa. She sang from the core of her heart about her unique spiritual experiences. She was indeed one of the foremost embodiments of Premabhakthi that ever walked on earth.<br /><br /><br /><br />Sant Mirabai was a devotee of the highest order. She was immune to the criticism and suffering of the world. She was born a princess but forsook the pleasures of a palace for begging on the streets of Brindaban. She lived during a time of war and spiritual decline, but her life offered a shining example of the purest devotion. Many were inspired by her infectious devotion and spontaneous love for Shri Krishna. Sant Mirabai showed how a seeker could attain union with God, only through love. Her only message was that Krishna was her all.<br /><br />End.", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 1, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12axtujunu0hx1yb04ci53a3nq5sxwz1cg/people/plusoners"}, "replies": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12axtujunu0hx1yb04ci53a3nq5sxwz1cg/comments"}, "id": "z12ihzyphpuftr2fb23of5cwvtzcvdh1v", "objectType": "activity"}, "updated": "2013-10-22T12:05:37.952Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/117270501844596314609", "image": {"url": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ozTKLlkoyO8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABWo/ZTjFihytWuA/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Ramavarma Parameswaran", "id": "117270501844596314609"}, "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "india the devine land (Discussion)"}, "verb": "share", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/2IXcvsQtDNUtqA9EAJDw7W8TICw\"", "published": "2013-10-22T12:05:37.952Z", "id": "z12axtujunu0hx1yb04ci53a3nq5sxwz1cg"}, "NONE"]
