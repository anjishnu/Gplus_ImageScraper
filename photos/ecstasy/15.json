Harlan Smith :\n\nLodovico Carracci \u00a01555-1619 \u00a0Italian Early Baroque genre and historical painter.\nA man named Johann Joachim Winckelman (1717-1768) was a German art historian who was one of the primary founders of scientific Archaeology. He was the first to arrange the categories of artistic styles on a broad, systematic basis for the history or art. He is regarded, therefore, as the father of the discipline of art history, and it was he who coined the term Eclectic to the Bolognese School of art created by Lodovico Carricci and his cousins Annibale and Agostino from Bologna. The Carravacci were responsible for bringing painting out of the Mannerist style and into the Baroque movement which was regarded then as avant-garde.\nThe Eclectic school of art was unique in that it was not a style in itself, but rather a mix of the styles of several different elements from the work of other artists to create an entirely new style. The focus was specifically on the Renaissance and Classic periods. What you will see in the work of Lodovico, and his cousins, is the more realistically drawn figure of Michelangelo, a departure from the elongated exaggerations of Mannerism; the brighter palette of Titian, another departure from the grayed palette of Mannerism; Coreggio's chiaroscuro, an element completely absent from Mannerism; and a finer symmetry and grace in the rendering of a painting, also sadly missing from Mannerism. With that you are looking at the nature of Baroque painting by definition.\nIt may be informative to say that Baroque was a movement because it was in fact a departure from Mannerism, and a style because it was a new method of painting. It was eclectic because of the combination of different elements. You might say it was a new invention using current technology.\n\n#art \u00a0#treadlightly \u00a0#artandclassontheplus \u00a0#EuropeanHistory \u00a0#europeanpainting #yourdailyartstory #arthistory", "fullImage": {"url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7BhPb6ZxLIQ/UnYub3l13ZI/AAAAAAAAjFE/rxA1fc6Uy9U/w637-h804/2013-11-03%2BLudovico_Carraci_-_Dream_of_St._Catherine.jpg", "width": 637, "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 804}, "url": "https://plus.google.com/photos/107700027720351417295/albums/5941554559600387041/5941987814675963282", "image": {"url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7BhPb6ZxLIQ/UnYub3l13ZI/AAAAAAAAjFE/rxA1fc6Uy9U/w506-h750/2013-11-03%2BLudovico_Carraci_-_Dream_of_St._Catherine.jpg", "width": 506, "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 750}, "content": "2013-11-03 Ludovico_Carraci_-_Dream_of_St._Catherine.jpg", "id": "107700027720351417295.5941987814675963282", "objectType": "photo"}], "url": "https://plus.google.com/107700027720351417295/posts/4YF88STnWjs", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/107700027720351417295", "image": {"url": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-eJuRVQx2bTE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAiS4/BOJmuauHXNQ/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Susanne Ramharter", "id": "107700027720351417295"}, "content": "<b>Good Morning Google+ \u00a0your daily story about art:</b> 11.03<br />November 3rd, is believed by some to be the date of the death of <b>Ludovico Carracci,</b> the cousin of the more famous Annibale, and who died in 1619. \u00a0Like his more famous cousins Annibale and Augostino, Ludovico was born in Bologna. \u00a0Unlike them however, he spent most of his life in Bologna and was rather introverted, slow to speak and given to both piety and introspection. \u00a0Along with his background as the son of a butcher, these traits early on gained him the nickname &quot;the Ox&quot;.\u00a0<br /><br />But the innovations of this &quot;Ox&quot; were to have a very lasting effect on art history, even if he is still in the shadow of his cousins. \u00a0As oldest of the three, Ludovico was the driving force in developing the eclectic manner that <span class=\"proflinkWrapper\"><span class=\"proflinkPrefix\">+</span><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/111119182400063476715\" class=\"proflink\" oid=\"111119182400063476715\">R.
