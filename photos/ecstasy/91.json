This oneness is what was hidden in the sex act. The sex was just the outer core. Now this is the meaning - the central point. This is what you were longing for, this is what the hankering was for. This was for what there was the search - this unity, this dissolving of the ego, this feeling of oneness, this ecstasy of non-tension, this ecstasy of relaxation. This was the meaning, the goal, and this is what you were searching for through this woman and that, through this man and that. You were searching and searching, but no woman can fulfill it, no man can give it.\n\nOnly through a deep tantric awareness does the sex act completely disappear, and a deep ecstasy is revealed.
