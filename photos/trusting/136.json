Search for something similar online. Remember there are not many NEW ideas, just improved ones. Chances are you can find that same shiny object for FREE.<br /><br />2. Read reviews of course. If the shiny object is fairly new there may not be reviews yet. That is a good sign to WAIT before you buy. (Beware of fake or incentivised reviews) In about a week or two you may find a discounted price. Also subscribe to the offers mailing list bc price may also be discounted within that time period. Do not fall for the &quot;Hope of Gain, Fear of Loss,&quot; sales hype!!<br /><br />Oh ya and try to stay away from &quot;Squeeze pages&quot; LOL. If you get that feeling of anxiety in your gut..Don&#39;t Buy! Bookmark it. TIP: \u00a0I have a bookmark folder called \u201cThings I want to buy\u201d Usually when I review that folder in a week or two later I find what I wanted to buy -I don&#39;t need anymore:)<br /><br />3. Ask friends to review the product for second opinions and if favorable consider inviting them for a &quot;Group Buy&quot; reducing your out of pocket expenses.<br /><br />4. Ask at least 3 pre-sale support questions to measure support response time. Better yet, if they have a phone number, call them. Many marketers don&#39;t want phone calls -just profits.<br /><br />5. Anything more than $100, I would stay away from. Be patient. Internet marketing takes time. Sometimes putting yourself through the learning curves is your best bet. There are no shining objects that will boost your exposure and profits overnight, \u201cLong-Term\u201d. And if you find something that works..Great! Chances are though -you will enjoy only temporary results.<br /><br />6. Get Rich Quick Schemes. I love this one. Remember anything invented that makes a ton of money on the internet is kept as a well guarded trade secret. Why would anyone want to sell something that is making THEM a ton of money? (Beware of online courses). And dont fall for all the bogus reasons. Bottom line: if they are selling a get rich scheme, chances are that by the time its up for sale the market is already over-saturated with it and it\u2019s no longer working as effectively as it once did.<br /><br />Finally, hard work, dedication, tenacity, preparation and timing are the key elements to online success. Make online failure(s) your best friend. We learn from failing. The worst thing about failing is the loss of \u201cTime.\u201d \u00a0Combining that with the loss of money -can be excruciating..<br /><br />Its all about building trusting relationships online folks and that cannot be bought!<br />~~~~~<br /><span class=\"proflinkWrapper\"><span class=\"proflinkPrefix\">+</span><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/109182412582243108689\" class=\"proflink\" oid=\"109182412582243108689\">WithBrains.com | Google+ Hangouts with DavidV.tv</a></span><br /><span class=\"proflinkWrapper\"><span class=\"proflinkPrefix\">+</span><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/109333295897329442817\" class=\"proflink\" oid=\"109333295897329442817\">David V</a></span><br /><br /><a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23workathome\">#workathome</a>  <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23hangouttips\">#hangouttips</a>   <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23shinyobjects\">#shinyobjects</a>   <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23getrichquick\">#getrichquick</a>   <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23internetmarketingtools\">#internetmarketingtools</a>   <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23marketingsoftware\">#marketingsoftware</a>   <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23marketingscripts\">#marketingscripts</a>   <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23marketingtools\">#marketingtools</a>   <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23hangoutSEO\">#hangoutSEO</a>   <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23videoSEO\">#videoSEO</a>   <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23youtubeSEO\">#youtubeSEO</a>", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13lwlqjxki4yz3c223ovbra5xakxpkra04/people/plusoners"}, "replies": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13lwlqjxki4yz3c223ovbra5xakxpkra04/comments"}, "objectType": "note"}, "updated": "2013-11-01T18:07:37.000Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/109182412582243108689", "image": {"url": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-XU0ZaRKFpMo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEE/i7w1kT95RWI/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "WithBrains.com | Google+ Hangouts with DavidV.tv", "id": "109182412582243108689"}, "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "Public"}, "verb": "post", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/h9ZJPY1rzsrJ7Tl_Gha6q7EovxM\"", "published": "2013-11-01T18:02:08.134Z", "id": "z13lwlqjxki4yz3c223ovbra5xakxpkra04"}, "NONE"]
