At the time of surgery the women are aged and weak\u2026.secondly the the arteries of women\u2019s heart are small in general\u2026and the blood vessel that is used in bypass surgery\u2026. does not perform well\u2026 says Dr.Barbara Philips of Duke university \u00a0medical center of US.These results are found on 300 patients\u2026in a study.\n\n>>WHAT IS HEART DISEASE?\nHeart disease begins when cholesterol, fatty material, and calcium build up in the arteries. When this occurs in the arteries that supply the heart, this buildup, or plaque, causes the arteries to narrow, so that oxygen delivery to the heart is reduced. The reduction in oxygen delivery to the heart can create chest pain, also called angina.\n>>THE LINK BETWEEN HEART DISEASE AND HEART ATTACK:\nWhen plaque builds up to the point that it ruptures, it causes a blood clot to form in the coronary artery. The blood clot blocks blood from flowing to the heart muscle, leading to a heart attack. In a worst-case scenario, sudden cardiac arrest or fatal rhythm disturbance can occur.\n>>WHAT ARE THE RISK FACTORS OF HEART DISEASE?\nSmoking\u2026.high blood pressure (hypertension)\u2026\u2026 high cholesterol\u2026..diabetes\u2026..family \u00a0\u00a0history of heart disease\u2026. lack of exercise\u2026..high-fat diet\u2026..emotional stress and having a \"type A\" personality (aggressive, impatient, competitive).\n\n>>What are the heart disease symptoms in women, seniors, and people with diabetes?\nFor many women, seniors, and people with diabetes, pain is not a symptom of heart disease at all. Instead of experiencing discomfort, they often have symptoms of malaise or fatigue.\n\n>>WHAT ARE THE COMMON SYMPTOMS OF HEAR DISEASE:\nSymptoms of heart disease usually occur during exercise or activity. That's because the heart experiences increased demand for nutrients and oxygen that cannot be met because the coronary arteries are blocked. Other symptoms of heart disease include:\u00a0\u00a0 chest pain (angina).... shortness of breath\u2026\u2026 jaw pain and back pain\u2026..especially on the left side.\n\n>>THE SYMPTOMS IN WOMENS FOR HEAR DISEASE:\nThe movies make it seem like heart attacks are easy to self-diagnose\u2014your arm loses feeling, you clutch your heart, you fall over. But the truth is that the symptoms may be way less easy to identify\u2014especially for women.\nAccording to the American Heart Association, heart disease is the No. 1 killer of women\u2014and lots of us miss the symptoms when they're happening. We're usually busy taking care of our friends and families, and just chalk up our feeling weird-ness to things like acid reflux, the flu, or just general aging. Some of our symptoms are \"silent\"\u2014and a lot more confusing. Like:\n\n1: Uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, fullness or pain in the center of your chest. The feeling lasts more than a few minutes, or goes away and comes back.\n2: You feel pain or discomfort in your jaw, neck, stomach, back, or your arm(s). This is apparently more common in women than in men, and very easy to dismiss (especially the jaw and neck pain). And you might think your stomach pain is due to acid reflux or heartburn. Experts say you should report any atypical, unexplained pain that you feel above your waist to your physician.\n3: \u00a0You feel short of breath, without having exerted yourself. If you experience this with any other symptom, it could be a sign of heart attack.\n4: \u00a0Sweating\u2014like breaking out into a cold sweat, the kind you might feel when you're fighting the flu.\n5: \u00a0Extreme fatigue. Some patients say their chests \"felt tired\" and that even getting up to walk to another part of the house was taxing.\n\nThanks and best regards with best wishes for good health and condition\u2026trusting to have been of services to you I remain\u2026..\n\nSincerely Yours,\nMadan M Pandey (Ayurveda activist, freelance herbalist and research scholar on fundamentals of Ayurveda and rare remedies)\n\n>>>QUERY\u2026.
