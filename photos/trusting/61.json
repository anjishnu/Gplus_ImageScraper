Officer Thomas was about to arrest Jessica Robles but changed her mind at the last minute.<br /><br />Instead of arresting her, she bought Robles $100 worth of groceries:<br /><br />\u201cI made the decision to buy her some groceries because arresting her wasn&#39;t going to solve the problem with her children being hungry.\u201d<br /><br />And there\u2019s no denying they were hungry. Robles\u2019 12 year old daughter started crying when she told local TV station WSVN about how dire their situation was:<br /><br />\u201c[It&#39;s] not fun to see my brother in the dirt hungry, asking for food, and we have to tell him, \u2018There is nothing here.\u2019&quot;<br /><br />Officer Thomas says she has no question that what she did was right:<br /><br />\u201cTo see them go through the bags when we brought them in, it was like Christmas. That $100 to me was worth it.\u201d<br /><br />But Officer Thomas did have one request:<br /><br />\u201cThe only thing I asked of her is, when she gets on her feet, that she help someone else out. And she said she would.\u201d<br /><br />And guess what? The story gets even better.<br /><br />After word got out about what happened people donated another $700 for Jessica Robles to spend at the grocery store.<br /><br />And then best of all a local business owner invited her in for an interview and ended up hiring her on the spot as a customer service rep.<br /><br />She started crying when he told her:<br /><br />\u201cThere&#39;s no words how grateful I am that you took your time and helped somebody out. Especially somebody like me.\u201d<br /><br />And to think it all started with one veteran police officer trusting her \u201cinstinct\u201d instead of going \u201cby the book\u201d.<br /><br />Courtesy WSVN", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 17, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13afbgx0w3ahpejk04cg5liplmsjthr2mk0k/people/plusoners"}, "replies": {"totalItems": 5, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13afbgx0w3ahpejk04cg5liplmsjthr2mk0k/comments"}, "id": "z12ccbx41uiezdy3f23qezer4yffhrafg", "objectType": "activity"}, "updated": "2013-11-05T19:02:47.000Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/111467014974214199699", "image": {"url": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-okhs52y_Jho/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAABGdc/s32SSqNyRAg/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Jonathon Barton", "id": "111467014974214199699"}, "annotation": "Just a reminder that sometimes <b>not</b> following the rules is the right thing to do.", "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "Public"}, "verb": "share", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/nLZ20tIwLqzWT3Bp5ROsac25Ukg\"", "published": "2013-11-05T18:32:54.360Z", "id": "z13afbgx0w3ahpejk04cg5liplmsjthr2mk0k"}, {"items": [{"inReplyTo": [{"url": "https://plus.google.com/111467014974214199699/posts/hCTnD1KP4wM", "id": "z13afbgx0w3ahpejk04cg5liplmsjthr2mk0k"}], "kind": "plus#comment", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 0}, "object": {"content": "$100 to completely 180 a family&#39;s life is chump change compared to what they could do with the new direction they&#39;re headed.
