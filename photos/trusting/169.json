Forgive as the Lord forgave you.<br /><br />Psalm 103:3<br />Who forgives all your iniquities,<br />Who heals all your diseases,<br /><br />Daniel 9:9<br />To the Lord our God belong mercy and forgiveness, though we have rebelled against Him.<br /><br />Mark 11:25<br />And whenever you stand praying, if you have anything against anyone, forgive him, that your Father in heaven may also forgive you your trespasses.<br /><br />To understand forgiveness we must realize what forgiveness is NOT:<br />\u00b7 Forgiveness is not forgetting. Deep hurts can rarely be wiped out of one\u2019s awareness.<br />\u00b7 Forgiveness is not reconciliation. Reconciliation takes two persons, but an injured party can forgive an offender without reconciliation.<br />\u00b7 Forgiveness is not condoning. Forgiveness does not necessarily excuse bad or hurtful behavior.<br />\u00b7 Forgiveness is not dismissing. It involves taking the offense seriously, not passing it off as inconsequential or insignificant.<br />\u00b7 Forgiveness is not a vague notion of \u2018tolerance\u2019. This is, at best, a low-grade parody of forgiveness. At worst, it\u2019s a way of sweeping the real issues in life under the carpet.<br />\u00b7 Forgiveness is not pardoning. A pardon is a legal transaction that releases an offender from the consequences of an action, such as a penalty.<br />Throughout the Old Testament we read that only God can forgive sins. We hear David exclaim, \u201cHe forgives all my sins\u2026\u201d (Psalm 103:3). We also see examples of human forgiveness\u2014even in pain\u2014like Joseph forgiving his brothers for selling him into slavery. Joseph gains true freedom. He then names his son Manasseh, \u201cone who causes to be forgotten.\u201d<br />In the New Testament we see Jesus, the Lamb of God, come into to the world to die for our sins. Through His shed blood we can once and for all receive ultimate forgiveness. This is the pure \u201cgospel of grace.\u201d This forgiveness is a gift. We do not deserve it but God, in His grace, reached out to provide forgiveness to a dying world.<br />Then we read in the verse above the impact of this on those of us who have received that forgiveness. Its ethical challenge parallels \u201clove your enemies\u201d and \u201cpray for your persecutors.\u201d<br />In the final analysis, forgiveness is an act of faith. By forgiving another, I am trusting that God is a better justice-maker than I am. By forgiving, I release my own right to get even and leave all issues of fairness for God to work out. I leave in God\u2019s hands the scales that must balance justice and mercy. I simply forgive others and leave them to God.<br />RESPONSE: Today I will leave fairness and justice in God\u2019s hands. I will obediently forgive others just as the Lord forgave me.<br />PRAYER: Lord, grant me the faith to trust You with the offenses committed against me. I will forgive.<br />Standing Strong Through The Storm (SSTS)<br />A daily devotional message by SSTS author Paul Estabrooks<br />\u00a9 2011 Open Doors International.
