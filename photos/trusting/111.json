I am happy to be me! \u00a0I have so much to be grateful for! \u00a0My life isn\u2019t perfect, it\u2019s just pretty darn good!\u201d\n\n3. \u00a0\u201cThe way it is now is the way it will always be.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t confuse your path with your destination. \u00a0Just because it\u2019s stormy now, doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t headed for sunshine. \u00a0And remember, you cannot heal a lifetime of pain overnight; be patient with yourself, it takes as long as it takes, but your happiness is well worth the wait.\n\nYou write your own destiny through the choices you make. \u00a0You become what you repeatedly do. \u00a0It is more important to know where you are going and why, than to get there quickly. \u00a0Do not mistake activity for achievement. \u00a0Every time you are tempted to react to the same old circumstances in the same old way, ask yourself, \u201cDo I want to be a prisoner of the past, or a pioneer of the future?\u201d\n\n4. \u00a0\u201cLife is supposed to be easy.\u201d\n\nNothing worthwhile in life was meant to be easy; learn to take it easy with your expectations in this area. \u00a0Don\u2019t expect things to be given to you. \u00a0Go out and achieve them! \u00a0It\u2019s the only sane way to deal with life\u2019s challenges. \u00a0If it\u2019s worth having, it\u2019s worth working for.\n\nAnyone can run away and waste away; it\u2019s super easy to do nothing. \u00a0Facing challenges and working through them, that\u2019s what makes you strong. \u00a0And even on your weakest days you get a bit stronger. \u00a0So TODAY, stop wishing for it and start working for it. \u00a0Talk is cheap. \u00a0Action is priceless. \u00a0(Read Flourish.)\n\n\n5. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s easier to blame someone else.\u201d\n\nToo many of us only take credit for positive outcomes. \u00a0In other words, we take full credit for our successes, but deny responsibility for our failures. \u00a0A perfect example of this can be witnessed in school classrooms across the globe. \u00a0When students receive a good grade, they often attribute it to their intelligence and their excellent study habits. \u00a0But when they get a bad grade, they attribute some of their failure to a bad teacher, an unfair set of test questions, or a subject matter that \u201cisn\u2019t needed in the real world anyway.\u201d\n\nRealize that in order for you to grow emotionally, you must be willing to take full responsibility for all your actions and outcomes \u2013 successes and failures alike. \u00a0Because if you are too afraid of failure, you can\u2019t possibly do what needs to be done to be successful. \u00a0Setbacks, failures, obstacles, and hardships are the contractors of life; they build character, strength and knowledge.\n\n6. \u00a0\u201cI just can\u2019t stand X, Y and Z!\u201d\n\nToday, let your small annoyances go. \u00a0Move through your day consciously. \u00a0Make an effort to notice at least one insignificant little frustration that you would normally get frustrated about. \u00a0Then do yourself a favor and simply let it go. \u00a0Experience, in this little way, the freedom of being in control of the way you feel. \u00a0And realize that you can extend this same level of control to every situation you encounter in life.\n\nAt any given moment, the way you feel is the way you choose to feel, and the way you react is the way you choose to react.\n\n7. \u00a0\u201cThey look a certain way, so they must be a certain way.\u201d\n\nSuperficial judgments are made the instant one person assumes something about another person based on their immediate appearance. \u00a0Sadly, this likely happens thousands of times every minute, all around the world. \u00a0 For example, someone might see a tall, well groomed man in his early fifties wearing a business suit, and instantly assume he is successful and reliable, even though there is zero concrete evidence to support this assumption.\n\nBottom line: \u00a0Don\u2019t judge a person by what they show you in a single glance. \u00a0What you\u2019ve seen is oftentimes only what they have chosen to show you at that particular moment. \u00a0Too often we jump to conclusions. \u00a0Talk with people, listen to their stories, watch what they do \u2013 this is how you get to know who they truly are.\n\n\n8. \u00a0\u201cGiving up and starting over is a sign of failure.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t try to diminish your losses from a past failure by continuing to follow the exact same path that led to the failure in the first place. \u00a0In other words, don\u2019t do the same thing over and over again and expect different results. \u00a0If it didn\u2019t work last time, and you haven\u2019t made any significant changes, it probably won\u2019t work this time either.\n\nSometimes we justify our decision to continue investing in a failed endeavor based solely on our cumulative prior investment, despite new evidence suggesting that the cost, starting today, of continuing to pursue it outweighs the expected benefit. \u00a0The logical thing to do would be for us to cut our losses and change our course of action. \u00a0However, due to the sunk costs we have already invested, we feel committed to the endeavor, so we invest even more time, money and energy into it, hoping that our additional investment will reverse the outcome. \u00a0But most of the time it never will.\n\nWhen you can no longer think of a reason to continue, you must think of a reason to start over, and that\u2019s perfectly OK. \u00a0There\u2019s a big difference between giving up and starting over in the right direction.\n\n\n9. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s too late. \u00a0I missed my chance.\u201d\n\nBe done with regrets; they are an excuse for people who have given up. \u00a0You are still here trying and growing. \u00a0Life is about learning from the past, trusting your intuition going forward, taking chances, finding moments of happiness, and realizing everything is simply a lesson that happens for a reason.\n\nDon\u2019t stress over what could\u2019ve been; chances are if it should\u2019ve been, it would\u2019ve been. \u00a0Focus on the present; you have a lot to look forward to in it. \u00a0Just do your best. \u00a0Every moment gives you a new beginning and a new ending. \u00a0You get a second chance, every second. \u00a0And YOUR best chance is happening right NOW.\n\nAfterthoughts and next steps\u2026\n\nThe Dalai Lama once said, \u201cA new way of thinking has become the necessary condition for responsible living and acting. \u00a0If we maintain obsolete values and beliefs, a fragmented consciousness and self-centered spirit, we will continue to hold onto outdated goals and behaviors.\u201d\n\nTODAY, make it a point to defragment your consciousness and center your spirit on positive, productive thoughts. \u00a0Whatever you do, don\u2019t get stuck on the one thing that ruins your day. \u00a0Smile and be grateful. \u00a0Life is too short to waste on negativity and destructive thinking.\n\n\n\nSource: Marc and Angel Hack Life", "fullImage": {"url": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Rf7reZRdB4A/UnX8NV4i45I/AAAAAAAAHl0/NikPN-9xr0Y/w586-h340/08.jpg", "width": 586, "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 340}, "url": "https://plus.google.com/photos/112998564518959699884/albums/5941932589860406577/5941932589528048530", "image": {"url": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Rf7reZRdB4A/UnX8NV4i45I/AAAAAAAAHl0/NikPN-9xr0Y/w506-h750/08.jpg", "width": 506, "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 750}, "content": "08.jpg", "id": "112998564518959699884.5941932589528048530", "objectType": "photo"}], "url": "https://plus.google.com/112998564518959699884/posts/Q1sxTHaYo1N", "content": "9 Thoughts YOU Need Out of Your Mind<br /><br />\u201cThe world as we have created it is a process of our thinking.\u201d\u2015Albert Einstein<br /><br />The human mind is wonderful and powerful, but it\u2019s far from perfect. \u00a0Too often we are addicted to our thoughts, and we can\u2019t change anything in our lives if we can\u2019t change our thinking. \u00a0If you want to move forward with your life, you must change your mind and get these thoughts OUT of it:<br />\u00a0<br />1. \u00a0\u201cLife sucks and that\u2019s just the way it is.\u201d<br />\u00a0<br />The mind can be the harshest battleground. \u00a0It can be the place where the greatest conflicts are carried out. \u00a0It\u2019s where half of the things you thought were going to happen, never came to be. \u00a0But if you allow those thoughts to dwell in your mind and fester, they will succeed in robbing you of peace, of happiness, and of everything that is beautiful in this world.<br />Tell the negativity committee that meets inside your head to sit down and shut up. \u00a0Don\u2019t think yourself into a nervous breakdown, into depression, into hopeless defeat. \u00a0If you\u2019re being negative when you\u2019re alone, the warfare is in your mind. \u00a0The fight you\u2019ve got to fight is in your mind. \u00a0You can\u2019t change what has happened, but you can choose how you\u2019re going to deal with it.<br />\u00a0<br />2. \u00a0\u201cThose haters are right about me.\u201d<br />\u00a0<br />Be wise enough to walk away from the negativity around you;
