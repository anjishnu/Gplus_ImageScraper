I know it's difficult to completely open yourself up after being hurt, but nobody can promise that loving someone won't hurt. In fact, you can't love without being willing to be hurt. It's not possible.\n\nYou can't have real love unless you're willing to forgive. Love keeps giving the other person another chance. Love keeps trusting them over and over again, expecting them to do the right thing the next time, believing the best of them.\n\nI realize there might be big hurts in your marriage, along with little things you deal with daily. Still, you need to decide to let go of its irritating hold on you.\n\nIf you're struggling with unforgiveness in your marriage, ask the Lord to reveal what has caused you to feel bitterness or resentment. You may be surprised at what He reveals to you, but when you see the truth, decide to let go of that grief. Decide to forgive your spouse and walk in patience as you treat them with God's amazing, unconditional love.\n\nPrayer Starter: God, I want my marriage to be the best it can be. Help me let go of any areas of unforgiveness and to patiently love my spouse the way You want me to.\n\nAmen amen amen!", "fullImage": {"url": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-4CwE9-epxPA/UnZmYDtuGiI/AAAAAAAAHwQ/9KFKqOjtZaw/w640-h1136/IMG_2718.PNG", "width": 640, "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 1136}, "url": "https://plus.google.com/photos/111097157237510919911/albums/5942049322544050321/5942049321861913122", "image": {"url": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-4CwE9-epxPA/UnZmYDtuGiI/AAAAAAAAHwQ/9KFKqOjtZaw/w506-h750/IMG_2718.PNG", "width": 506, "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 750}, "content": "IMG_2718.PNG", "id": "111097157237510919911.5942049321861913122", "objectType": "photo"}], "url": "https://plus.google.com/111097157237510919911/posts/ZGjybtURVLb", "content": "How Forgiveness and Patience Can Help Your Marriage <br />(Joyce Meyer)<br /><br />Marriages are not as good as they could be when someone holds on to offenses and hurts that their spouse has caused.
