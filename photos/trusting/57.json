Officer Thomas was about to arrest Jessica Robles but changed her mind at the last minute.<br /><br />Instead of arresting her, she bought Robles $100 worth of groceries:<br /><br />\u201cI made the decision to buy her some groceries because arresting her wasn&#39;t going to solve the problem with her children being hungry.\u201d<br /><br />And there\u2019s no denying they were hungry. Robles\u2019 12 year old daughter started crying when she told local TV station WSVN about how dire their situation was:<br /><br />\u201c[It&#39;s] not fun to see my brother in the dirt hungry, asking for food, and we have to tell him, \u2018There is nothing here.\u2019&quot;<br /><br />Officer Thomas says she has no question that what she did was right:<br /><br />\u201cTo see them go through the bags when we brought them in, it was like Christmas. That $100 to me was worth it.\u201d<br /><br />But Officer Thomas did have one request:<br /><br />\u201cThe only thing I asked of her is, when she gets on her feet, that she help someone else out. And she said she would.\u201d<br /><br />And guess what? The story gets even better.<br /><br />After word got out about what happened people donated another $700 for Jessica Robles to spend at the grocery store.<br /><br />And then best of all a local business owner invited her in for an interview and ended up hiring her on the spot as a customer service rep.<br /><br />She started crying when he told her:<br /><br />\u201cThere&#39;s no words how grateful I am that you took your time and helped somebody out. Especially somebody like me.\u201d<br /><br />And to think it all started with one veteran police officer trusting her \u201cinstinct\u201d instead of going \u201cby the book\u201d.<br /><br />Courtesy WSVN", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 1, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13qs5vqslzfvpqtw23dghriwmntubp0x/people/plusoners"}, "replies": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13qs5vqslzfvpqtw23dghriwmntubp0x/comments"}, "id": "z12ccbx41uiezdy3f23qezer4yffhrafg", "objectType": "activity"}, "updated": "2013-11-05T21:13:18.711Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/107995417994917529008", "image": {"url": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Lk-6wwwD3n0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAbM/WOra84Du2uk/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "nicole matiskainen", "id": "107995417994917529008"}, "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "Public"}, "verb": "share", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/8K9HNn9mTEZEL-BGCx8ETUvaI70\"", "published": "2013-11-05T21:13:18.711Z", "id": "z13qs5vqslzfvpqtw23dghriwmntubp0x"}, "NONE"]
