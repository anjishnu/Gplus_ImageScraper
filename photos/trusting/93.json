Instead, he built another house in his own name. Jesus had put up his own church which was not part of his work as specified in the prophecies. This deception was used as the foundation of faith of the many religions. By building a church in his own name, Jesus had made himself to be known as a god rather than making his fellow Israelites know the true name of God!Since the religions made us worship Jesus who- as based on God\u2019s word in the prophecy in 2 Samuel 7:12-14 was punished by God for his own wrongdoing and not for our sins as the apostles claim, it is clear that we were taught by the religions an erroneous teaching about God. This is why God does not hear the prayer of the peoples of the world for peace but continues to let mankind suffer from all these wars and disasters because they are calling on a false god made by the apostles.\"\n\nDefinitely you can see first hand what is present in our world today. Attacking our bible and cursing the name of Jesus and to boot a man who believes in this is claimed to be a true prophet. We know from Genesis 3:1 the devil is subtle so I wanted to show you brothers and sisters why you don your armor of God and take up the sword of the spirit and battle the devil and his kin. No quarter given and without retreat. In the name of Jesus we rebuke this dark doctrine and we silence the devil's kin for spreading the virus that is the dark doctrine.\n\nKing James Version 1 Peter 5:8 8 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:9 Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.\n\n+Keith Shobe +Pete C +Roy Scott +K Staples stay strong in the word.
