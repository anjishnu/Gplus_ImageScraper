Think carefully about what he said: \u201cHas God indeed said, 'You shall not eat of every tree of the garden'?\u201d (Genesis 3:1) The Hebrew word there literally means \u201cfrom any.\u201d He was changing God\u2019s words. God had told Adam he could eat of every tree, except the one in the center of the garden. God gave this to Adam and Eve as a test, to show their love for Him. God could have created man with no free will, but then they wouldn\u2019t be able to express their love for him by choosing to obey.\n\nEve replied, \u201c\u2018We may eat the fruit of the trees of the garden; but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God has said, \u201cYou shall not eat it, nor shall you touch it, lest you die.\u201d\u2019\n\nThen the serpent said to the woman, \u2018You will not surely die. For God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.\u2019\u201d Genesis 3:2-5\n\nIt was true that Adam and Eve would not die right away, but they would begin to die. As soon as God\u2019s perfect presence and order was removed from the world, all of creation would begin to decline. They would begin to understand good and evil, but that was not something good. Instead of simply trusting and obeying God, they would rely on their own finite understanding to make decisions.\n\nShe doubted that God really wanted the best for them. Why would He keep them back from something that appeared to be good? Was God jealous, and wanted to keep them dependent? \u201cSo then the woman saw that the tree was good for food, that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree desirable to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate. She also gave to her husband with her, and he ate.\u201d Genesis 3:6\n\nCan you imagine that moment when God looked down and saw Eve take that fruit?
