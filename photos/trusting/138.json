It was first practiced by monks in the third century who, because very few Bibles were available at the time, would gather in chapel and listen to Scripture as it was read to them by a member of the community. They were encouraged to \u201clisten with their hearts\u201d because it was the Word of God they were hearing. They then would share what each had understood from the text, which then developed into a discussion. Finally, they offered prayer to God, both aloud and in silence, as a response to the Word they received.\n\nPope Francis and his predecessor have called for a return to the tradition of lectio divina as an essential part of the Church\u2019s plan for renewal of faith in our times. Pope Benedict XVI wrote: \u201cthe diligent reading of Sacred Scripture accompanied by prayer brings about that intimate dialogue in which the person reading hears God who is speaking, and in praying, responds to him with trusting openness of heart\" (cf. \"Dei Verbum,\" n. 25). If it is effectively promoted, this practice will bring to the Church -- I am convinced of it -- a new spiritual springtime.\u201d\n\n\u201cConversations With Our Father\u201d was written by members of the parish\u2019s Lectio Divina Prayer Group. In weekly meetings over the course of several months, members read, discussed and meditated on twelve passages from the Bible. They then composed prayers in response to how God\u2019s words affected their present lives.\n\n\u201cPublishing the prayers in a book was something of an afterthought,\u201d said Walter Burek, who is moderator for the group and also wrote the book\u2019s introduction and edited the collection, \u201cit was only on hearing, week after week, how beautiful and heartfelt so many of the prayers were, that I approached our pastor (Monsignor Joseph G. Prior) with the idea for the book. The members of the group agreed to have their writings published but, because so many of the prayers were so deeply personal, they asked that their names not be identified with particular prayers.\u201d\n\nMonsignor Prior stated, \u201cConversations With Our Father\u201d is ideal for anyone who wants to build a more personal relationship with a loving God. Prayerful reading of Sacred Scripture is an excellent way to do that. This book will help many people and lift them up in the Lord.
