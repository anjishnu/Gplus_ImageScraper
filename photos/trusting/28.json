Some go through trials as if it's a torture mechanism, that no one wants to see their success, not even God. But trust and believe, we go through not to tare us down, but to build us up and make us stronger. Each trial we endure helps us to be able to have the wisdom, knowledge, strength, and confidence to endure the next. Don't ask God to remove you from a situation, but take it, endure it, be determined, and prevail against it. Adapt a mind to say, \"Thank you Lord for trusting me to go through this situation. I won't let you down.\" And then believe in your heart in confidence that you will endure unto the end. Why, because you go into the trial already having the victory, why again you ask, because God is the one who fights all of our battles if we let him. It's when we try to step in and fight them that we fail, we give up, we are defeated, we stop. Don't stop, don't hide from it, but keep pushing. When you've done all you can do to stand...stand some more. #haveendurance #keepstriving #youcandothis #haveconfidenceinyourself", "fullImage": {"url": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-yF5UEC1jmLk/Unu9HDgeXXI/AAAAAAAADNk/-xXSLvGo8oc/w612-h612/13%2B-%2B1", "width": 612, "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 612}, "url": "https://plus.google.com/photos/109562004728286898220/albums/5943552064997929201/5943552062143749490", "image": {"url": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-yF5UEC1jmLk/Unu9HDgeXXI/AAAAAAAADNk/-xXSLvGo8oc/w506-h750/13%2B-%2B1", "width": 506, "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 750}, "content": "11/7/13 - 1", "id": "109562004728286898220.5943552062143749490", "objectType": "photo"}], "url": "https://plus.google.com/109562004728286898220/posts/C5TohiHN4p4", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/109562004728286898220", "image": {"url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-lrH5fBCF8SU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAB3s/skOE1B-N9nU/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Tynisha Nolan", "id": "109562004728286898220"}, "content": "Just because we ask God to remove a situation from coming and/or occurring does that mean we will not go through it.
