Expecting men to be self serving at best and lethal at worst is not a good way for a woman to live.&quot;<br /><br />From the article:<br /><br />&quot;But medical records produced in discovery show that in the year or so before she deployed overseas, Jones was treated with Effexor, an anti-depressant; Ambien, a sleeping pill; Lamictal, a drug prescribed for seizures and bipolar disorder; Vicodin, a painkiller; and Zoloft, an anti-anxiety drug.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Kelly, Jones&#39; lawyer, concedes that his client has some issues in her past. &quot;Jamie never claimed to be a perfectly clean slate when she walked in the door,&quot; he says.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Not only has the federal trial judge already thrown out large portions of her case, evidence introduced in the trial raises the question of whether Jones has exaggerated and embellished key aspects of her story.&quot;&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Jones claims that she was dosed with the date rape drug Rohypnol, which she believed was slipped into her drink by one of the KBR firefighters she was partying with in the Green Zone. In one of her congressional appearances, Jones said a contractor handed her a mixed drink and that &quot;I took two sips from the drink, and don&#39;t remember anything after that.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;One of those experts, Dr. Thomas Kosten, a psychiatry professor at the Baylor College of Medicine, observes in his report that Jones acknowledged having up to five alcoholic beverages over three hours on the night in question. Noting that Jones weighed 120 pounds at the time, he concludes that booze could have caused her amnesia.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;A lab analysis of the rape kit shows DNA from a single man, firefighter Charles Boartz, the only person Jones has identified in her lawsuit as one of the assailants. (Boatz is no saint; since returning from Iraq, he has had run-ins with the law related to domestic violence.) Several witnesses have testified to seeing Bortz and Jones drinking, flirting, and heading to her barracks together the night of the alleged attack, and Bortz has testified that the sex was consensual.&quot;<br /><br />The medical records do indicate that she may have been emotionally unstable. Thus, her conflicting statements.<br /><br />But she was drunk and flirting with a male co-worker. A huge mistake made by many young women.\u00a0<br /><br />Most men do not consider it &quot;rape&quot; to have sex with an extremely drunk woman. They percieve it as consentual because she went with him. She blacked out and has no memory of willingly going to the barracks with him. He did whatever he wanted to while she was unconscious. Easy and fun for him and a nightmare for her when she woke up.<br /><br />#1 SHE TRUSTED HIM! &quot;the only way for women to be safe is never trusting any man fully&quot; This man has &quot;has had run-ins with the law related to domestic violence&quot; and SHE TRUSTED HIM! He deliberately fed her drinks until she was drunk. NEVER let a man you barely know get you drunk! ALWAYS,stop drinking while you are functional! Tell him NO! Tell him you want to know what happens to you at all times. Leave the bar with someone else who is sober enough to know what they are doing. If you are driving, get a bar employee to escort you to your vehicle. If are to drunk to drive, drink water or coffee for awhile and sober up.", "objectType": "comment"}, "updated": "2013-11-01T07:25:38.738Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/110164333664766377987", "image": {"url": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-p_1AlcS2NYM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAMk/NXnPgxmKRyI/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Carol Ruby", "id": "110164333664766377987"}, "verb": "post", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/A3MQrZczwvEEdong1vFO56jiNGo\"", "published": "2013-11-01T07:25:38.738Z", "id": "z12mwhsx3nrlj10m422zflma5vmxfnmhb04.1383290738738531", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/comments/z12mwhsx3nrlj10m422zflma5vmxfnmhb04#1383290738738531"}, {"inReplyTo": [{"url": "https://plus.google.com/110164333664766377987/posts/CNuQVJdow9n", "id": "z12mwhsx3nrlj10m422zflma5vmxfnmhb04"}], "kind": "plus#comment", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 1}, "object": {"content": "To the point more about arbitration agreements- I would highly recommend the HBO documentary, &quot;Hot Coffee.&quot; I believed they covered one of these KBR cases.", "objectType": "comment"}, "updated": "2013-11-01T19:50:55.325Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/117650564560374175894", "image": {"url": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-7GOluj4kqhc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAA7M/XHdz2vGKjRU/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Jeffrey Edson", "id": "117650564560374175894"}, "verb": "post", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/Dc7v0rWg1wGAata61glDO-gKeec\"", "published": "2013-11-01T19:50:55.325Z", "id": "z12mwhsx3nrlj10m422zflma5vmxfnmhb04.1383335455325494", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/comments/z12mwhsx3nrlj10m422zflma5vmxfnmhb04#1383335455325494"}], "kind": "plus#commentFeed", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/wyOVmGXgxIY1fig2S6jxn4pH3dE\"", "title": "Google+ List of Comments for an Activity"}]
