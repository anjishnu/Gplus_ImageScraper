Just 10 minutes during your regular prayer time, on whatever day you commit to, dedicating that time to specifically lift up the prayer needs of our community members. You\u2019re committing to going before the throne of Grace to seek the hand of God to touch each member at their point of need. Another TTPT member will stand in the gap during their 10 minutes, and so on. The more we pray, the more things change. We are looking for committed prayer warriors to take on this task of standing in the gap for at least 10 minutes per week on behalf of our members. Will you answer this call? If this is speaking to you, praise God! There are many people standing in need and we have the authority to go before the Father on their behalf. PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHAT DAY OF THE WEEK AND TIME THAT YOU WILL BE PRAYING FOR US. I will put together a prayer calendar.\u00a0 May God richly bless you as you serve Him in this capacity. In Jesus name.<br />\u00a0<br />\u201cDevote yourselves to prayer, being watchful and thankful. \u00a0And pray for us, too, that God may open a door for our message, so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ, for which I am in chains. Pray that I may proclaim it clearly, as I should\u201d (Col. 4:2-4).", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12yfpzyoryaxn2zt04cef3jmsruifngksw0k/people/plusoners"}, "replies": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12yfpzyoryaxn2zt04cef3jmsruifngksw0k/comments"}, "id": "z13mcbbq5kn1jvqtd23njfroaxudgbkfi", "objectType": "activity"}, "updated": "2013-11-07T00:51:26.348Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/105551158172404956515", "image": {"url": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-4gZAjBOo8wk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABE/woveESAq368/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "olaniyan prince", "id": "105551158172404956515"}, "annotation": "i am indeed glad to be a partaker of this expansion of the kingdom of God by praying for the saint.", "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "Public"}, "verb": "share", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/Bw6gc-ZbPuT-hVKGXMbyQ9MNC9A\"", "published": "2013-11-07T00:51:26.348Z", "id": "z12yfpzyoryaxn2zt04cef3jmsruifngksw0k"}, "NONE"]
