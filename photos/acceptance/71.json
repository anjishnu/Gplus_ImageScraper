We think and behave irrationally, despite our best efforts. When anxious, frustrated, or overwhelmed by life, we do dumb things as a result...<br /><br />Even worse, we then <b>beat ourselves up</b> for our shortcomings. A voice in our mind says: \u201cyou&#39;re useless and pathetic\u201d or \u201cyou&#39;re a loser!\u201d We give ourselves a kicking simply for getting things wrong.\u00a0<br /><br />Perhaps we&#39;re trying to improve or change. But you would not use this strategy with family or friends; even strangers receive more respect. We may wish to get it right, but negative self-talk only derails us further.<br /><br />There has to be a better way. Instead, speak to yourself with compassion and kindness. Remember that you were just a kid once. When you catch negative self-talk, take a big deep breath, apologise, and ask yourself: \u201cOkay \u2013 nobody is perfect. How can we make it better next time?\u201d<br /><br /> <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23motivation\">#motivation</a> \u00a0 <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23confidence\">#confidence</a> \u00a0 <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23selfimprovement\">#selfimprovement</a> \u00a0 <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23confidencebuilding\">#confidencebuilding</a> \u00a0", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 3, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12ah3trmzqns1yjw04cj3ahpkzpuf0qg40/people/plusoners"}, "replies": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12ah3trmzqns1yjw04cj3ahpkzpuf0qg40/comments"}, "id": "z13htlqrykyisjmsn23stnhgbxims5n10", "objectType": "activity"}, "updated": "2013-11-05T18:50:51.995Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/107284521583388070529", "image": {"url": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-slgfOwoxhh4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAGU/cvS5g_gBLr0/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Adrian Tannock", "id": "107284521583388070529"}, "annotation": "Perhaps the key to acceptance is found in your relationship with yourself.
