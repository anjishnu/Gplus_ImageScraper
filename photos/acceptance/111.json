Even the cheap people get it. Honesty though should be cherished right up there with love, acceptance, respect, forgiveness, charity, even a smile, kind word,a good deed.I believe that all good things come from the God of the heavens and earth and every thing on them. Yes I can testify to the awesome love that my Abba,father, daddy,Jehovah, my daddy the king of kings,And I guaranty that He is not cheap in any way shape or form. After all how many people do you know that would give up their precious,and loved son. To be treated worse than any creature alive should have had to endure, let alone an innocent man. Yes you are right about honesty being expensive. But we can be grateful that God loved us, who don&#39;t deserve to exist. Let alone to be able to be totally free from the powers of darkness, death. And live in the light and have a life of total freedom. So I know what this woman is keep on doing, Just what I&#39;ve been doing for the last 27yrs and that is what my Jesus gave to me. Love, forgiveness, acceptance, kindness, compation, I can go on and on with the mercy He never runs out of for me. It&#39;s not hard at all to keep doing what I&#39;ve been doing. Its to hard not to, as you can all tell. Total freedom through the free gift of life and that is gotten from the only one who stepped up to pay the ultimate price His life for mine. So as you can tell I&#39;m as happy as can be to tell you and everyone I can what my precious savior Jesus Christ has done for me. And to show Him how grateful I am by giving freely what was given to me. I truly pray that God pours out His blessings on every one of you . And thank you so much for sharing about honesty. :-) ", "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "Public"}, "verb": "share", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/jNT099Fj8OnNZMDxTl4rrt7Au2k\"", "published": "2013-11-04T14:39:33.787Z", "id": "z12ke5mb5lrtth1xk04cc5shwk2tvreixwk0k"}, "NONE"]
