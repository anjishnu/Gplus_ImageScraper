At the park, she&#39;s a delightful companion who matches her walker&#39;s pace with an effortless and elegant glide, passing other dogs on the path with only a subtle glance. And when we rest, she stays serenely by my side while watching the world scurry by us. Indeed, her good looks and quiet manners are noticed by other people in the park who stop to admire her during her photo shoot. Despite joining us as a stray, Sophia appears to have been a member of a family as she comes promptly when called and sits very nicely for treats. She also greets a chow walking by her playpen with a wagging tail and quiet interest. While Sophia is sporting a bit of blemish on her lower jaw that might be an injury, or possibly a skin condition requiring a little TLC, it certainly doesn&#39;t detract from her overall loveliness or wonderful demeanor. Having performed well in her behavior evaluation, a home with an experienced owner may be the best fit for Sophia. So if you&#39;re looking for a canine friend with charm, grace and looks to match, come meet Sophia - she&#39;s one lovely girl!<br /><a href=\"https://m.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=629616090384607&amp;id=152876678058553&amp;set=a.617938651552351.1073741868.152876678058553&amp;ref=m_notif&amp;notif_t=notify_me&amp;__user=100003545376300\" class=\"ot-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://m.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=629616090384607&amp;id=152876678058553&amp;set=a.617938651552351.1073741868.152876678058553&amp;ref=m_notif&amp;notif_t=notify_me&amp;__user=100003545376300</a>", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12nc3x5woi4gbdsw224glrqptzwdl3b304/people/plusoners"}, "replies": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12nc3x5woi4gbdsw224glrqptzwdl3b304/comments"}, "id": "z12jgjry1lnzfbnrf04ci3zzyojhtrtavxw0k", "objectType": "activity"}, "updated": "2013-06-26T19:04:03.137Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/116444039208979949021", "image": {"url": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-TTY8h9glzog/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/IOJZNvMS0c4/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Rossella Lobono", "id": "116444039208979949021"}, "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "Public"}, "verb": "share", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/5Uq1wNu6su3djiYhselzY9qbOC8\"", "published": "2013-06-26T19:04:03.137Z", "id": "z12nc3x5woi4gbdsw224glrqptzwdl3b304"}, "NONE"]
