I don\u2019t think it\u2019s your job to tell young people that they should engage with the political process. But I do think that when you end a piece about politics with the injunction \u201cI will never vote and I don\u2019t think you should either\u201d, then you\u2019re actively telling a lot of people that engagement with our democracy is a bad idea. That just gives politicians the green light to neglect the concerns of young people because they\u2019ve been relieved of the responsibility of courting their vote.&quot;<br><br>&quot;They are not all the same. \u201cThey\u2019re all the same\u201d is what reactionaries love to hear. It leaves the status quo serenely untroubled, it cedes the floor to the easy answers of Ukip and the Daily Mail. No, if you want to be a nuisance to the people whom you most detest in public life, vote. And vote Labour.&quot;", "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "Public"}, "verb": "share", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/c8jG7uqv-B0p6fA87JMqDmFW8js\"", "published": "2013-11-01T12:05:42.183Z", "id": "z124xjv40niliteim04cizyp3ljweblp0oc0k"}, "NONE"]
