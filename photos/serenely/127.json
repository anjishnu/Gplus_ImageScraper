A colossal figure of Buddha cut from a granite wall was most serenely gazing at him from out of the foliage. &quot;I cannot describe what I felt at that moment,&quot; he wrote.<br /><br />&quot;Neither could I when I first saw the great statues at the tender age of 8. It was like dream that you dream when just about to wake up. And you wake up with the dream &amp; still on a cloud. But the upright Big Buddha most definitely smiled at me. Am I dreaming? No, Big Buddha smiled again.&quot; That&#39;s bunpeiris. There sprang up an eternal love on the spur of the moment: Gal Vihara was no longer a rock temple of rock carved statues. It is the heartthrob. If it was the flow of the sculptor&#39;s heart then, since then, it has been the stream that wash and cleanse the minds and the hearts of all those who stand in front of it. Stand, kneel or sit in front of the great statues. The sweeping serenity of the statues would breeze-open your heart and inflame it with eternal love. <a href=\"http://www.mysrilankaholidays.com/gal-vihara.html\" class=\"ot-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.mysrilankaholidays.com/gal-vihara.html</a>", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 4, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12eyln5jkm3u5yav04chddqlorachixt5c/people/plusoners"}, "replies": {"totalItems": 2, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12eyln5jkm3u5yav04chddqlorachixt5c/comments"}, "objectType": "note"}, "updated": "2013-04-16T07:30:42.119Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/107515144721133190300", "image": {"url": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-YJHIMG9S2C8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAF6M/c0xlQzIDawU/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "B UPUL N PEIRIS", "id": "107515144721133190300"}, "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "Public"}, "verb": "post", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/w53R1F183x1KWOdm9zzkaCzVvHU\"", "published": "2013-04-16T07:30:42.119Z", "id": "z12eyln5jkm3u5yav04chddqlorachixt5c"}, {"items": [{"inReplyTo": [{"url": "https://plus.google.com/107515144721133190300/posts/dngzD1LJKdE", "id": "z12eyln5jkm3u5yav04chddqlorachixt5c"}], "kind": "plus#comment", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 0}, "object": {"content": "aamazing", "objectType": "comment"}, "updated": "2013-04-16T16:45:42.116Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/117598836987315845134", "image": {"url": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-KGiPKkd1Eso/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAVk/Gx64cMZdUj4/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "saifuddin mullick", "id": "117598836987315845134"}, "verb": "post", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/tOIq1Mwybk2gHD-2nth1irxEcTQ\"", "published": "2013-04-16T16:45:42.116Z", "id": "z12eyln5jkm3u5yav04chddqlorachixt5c.1366130742116654", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/comments/z12eyln5jkm3u5yav04chddqlorachixt5c#1366130742116654"}, {"inReplyTo": [{"url": "https://plus.google.com/107515144721133190300/posts/dngzD1LJKdE", "id": "z12eyln5jkm3u5yav04chddqlorachixt5c"}], "kind": "plus#comment", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 0}, "object": {"content": "Gal Vihara was no longer a rock temple of rock carved statues.
