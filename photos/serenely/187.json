You have done what you could. Some blunders and absurdities no doubt have crept in; forget them as soon as you can. Tomorrow is a new day; begin it well and serenely and with too high a spirit to be cumbered with your old nonsense. This day is all that is good and fair. It is too dear, with its hopes and invitations, to waste a moment on yesterdays.&quot;</i><br /><br /><i>-Ralph Waldo Emerson</i><br /><br />I call this one &quot;Singularity&quot;. To me it represents a moment of thought and solitude... presented in a little island of rock that&#39;s stood the test of time in an ocean of change.
