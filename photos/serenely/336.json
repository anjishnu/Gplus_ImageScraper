When we experience serene joy, on both a physical and mental level, brought on by the force of total absorption of mind on mind, we achieve a meditational state that fulfills the definition of shamata.<br /><br />Our ordinary mind is like raw iron ore that needs to be made into a steel sword. Progressing through the stages for attaining shamata is like forging the iron into steel. All the materials are there at our disposal. But since the mind wanders after external objects, then although it is the material for attaining shamata, it cannot yet be used as this product. We have to forge our mind through a meditational process. It is like putting the iron ore into fire.<br /><br />To fashion the steel into a sword, or in this analogy to fashion the mind into an instrument that understands voidness, our serenely stilled and settled mind needs to come to decisive realization of voidness as its object. Without such a weapon of mind, we have no opponent with which to destroy the disturbing emotions and attitudes.(p.142)<br /><br />--from The Gelug/Kagyu Tradition of Mahamudra by H.H. the Dalai Lama and Alexander Berzin, published by Snow Lion Publications", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 2, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13penqavxicsfod323iitjzewjhfjctj/people/plusoners"}, "replies": {"totalItems": 3, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13penqavxicsfod323iitjzewjhfjctj/comments"}, "objectType": "note"}, "updated": "2011-10-15T09:17:49.801Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/112552063323035600956", "image": {"url": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-CSULlIn3Rws/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAEXs/KDMOFDlt6H8/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Richard Heilbrunn", "id": "112552063323035600956"}, "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "Public"}, "verb": "post", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/xggxI4ldfn-U3F7UonNF6etM504\"", "published": "2011-10-15T09:17:49.801Z", "id": "z13penqavxicsfod323iitjzewjhfjctj"}, {"items": [{"inReplyTo": [{"url": "https://plus.google.com/112552063323035600956/posts/6xgnZzr3o9b", "id": "z13penqavxicsfod323iitjzewjhfjctj"}], "kind": "plus#comment", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 0}, "object": {"content": "I don&#39;t understand Mahamudra with impermanence.

How can the nature of mind exist if everything is impermanent? <br /><br />At some point you have to look at what is meant by impermenant. Is impermenance impermenant? No, all is impermanent, everything that is of composite nature.<br /><br />There is the paradox. Experience is relative, therefore the basis has to be absolute. In order for anything to exist, everything impermanent, nothing has to exist to form it&#39;s basis. <br /><br />My favorite way to define Buddha Nature is the potential to become enlightened. This is really off the top of my head, I have just scratched the surface myself.<br /><br />Thanks for the words,<br />May this merit alleviate the suffering of beings", "objectType": "comment"}, "updated": "2011-10-26T20:49:35.360Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/105713223960534386075", "image": {"url": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ZtvrRwGd0WQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABg8/6wEyqMc_Ou0/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Albert Tremblay", "id": "105713223960534386075"}, "verb": "post", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/GK43z3V3UTYCW5GVsEcFdI_G1uY\"", "published": "2011-10-26T20:49:35.360Z", "id": "z13penqavxicsfod323iitjzewjhfjctj.1319662175360040", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/comments/z13penqavxicsfod323iitjzewjhfjctj#1319662175360040"}], "kind": "plus#commentFeed", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/Vbjo4iyzlEIqrlplka0-IYbbgGY\"", "title": "Google+ List of Comments for an Activity"}]
