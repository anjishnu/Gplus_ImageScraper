Because we are alone with the unfamiliar presence that has entered us; because everything we trust and are used to is for a moment taken away from us; because we stand in the midst of a transition where we cannot remain standing. That is why the sadness passes: the new presence inside us, the presence that has been added, has entered our heart, has gone into its innermost chamber and is no longer even there, - is already in our bloodstream. And we don&#39;t know what it was. We could easily be made to believe that nothing happened, and yet we have changed, as a house that a guest has entered changes. We can&#39;t say who has come, perhaps we will never know, but many signs indicate that the future enters us in this way in order to be transformed in us, long before it happens. And that is why it is so important to be solitary and attentive when one is sad: because the seemingly uneventful and motionless moment when our future steps into us is so much closer to life than that other loud and accidental point of time when it happens to us as if from outside. The quieter we are, the more patient and open we are in our sadnesses, the more deeply and serenely the new presence can enter us, and the more we can make it our own, the more it becomes our fate.\u201d \u00a0-\u00a0Rainer Maria Rilke", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 1, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13ufrbhuq3kg5fhp04cc5yafq2utbdo22k/people/plusoners"}, "replies": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13ufrbhuq3kg5fhp04cc5yafq2utbdo22k/comments"}, "objectType": "note"}, "updated": "2012-10-08T00:59:30.784Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/113807291675424205989", "image": {"url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-LgMLU0Ip6Fo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAl0/Xkl99czmuow/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "cly t.", "id": "113807291675424205989"}, "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "Public"}, "verb": "post", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/1ayE9vOllwGMns2IhTUQ59fQxww\"", "published": "2012-10-08T00:59:30.784Z", "id": "z13ufrbhuq3kg5fhp04cc5yafq2utbdo22k"}, "NONE"]
