The album was her second R&amp;B chart-topper, the follow-up to &quot;Aretha Arrives&quot; and included some of her biggest hit singles, &quot;Chain of Fools&quot; (#2 Pop), and (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman (#8 Pop), and &quot;(Sweet Sweet Baby) Since You&#39;ve Been Gone&quot; (#5 Pop). It eventually sold over a million copies in the United States alone. The album was reissued on Rhino Records in the early 1990s.<br /><br />Lady Soul peaked at #1, #2 and #3 on Billboard&#39;s Black Albums, Pop Albums and Jazz Albums charts respectively. The single &quot;Ain&#39;t No Way&quot; (B-Side of &quot;Since You&#39;ve Been Gone (Sweet, Sweet, Baby)&quot;) peaked at #9 on the Black Singles chart, and #16 on the Pop Singles chart.<br />Gospel/R&amp;B singer Cissy Houston (mother of Whitney Houston) and her group the Sweet Inspirations are credited as background vocals on several tracks, along with Aretha&#39;s sisters&#39; Carole and Emma Franklin. In 2003 the TV network VH1 named Lady Soul the 41st greatest album of all time. It is number 84 on Rolling Stone&#39;s list &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;.<br /><br />REVIEW<br />by John Bush, allmusic<br />Appearing after a blockbuster debut and a sophomore set that was rather disappointing (in comparison), 1968&#39;s Lady Soul proved Aretha Franklin, the pop sensation, was no fluke. Her performances were more impassioned than on her debut, and the material just as strong, an inspired blend of covers and originals from the best songwriters in soul and pop music. The opener, &quot;Chain of Fools,&quot; became the biggest hit, driven by a chorus of cascading echoes by Franklin and her bedrock backing vocalists, the Sweet Impressions, plus the unforgettable, earthy guitar work of guest Joe South. The album&#39;s showpiece, though, was &quot;(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman,&quot; a song written expressly for her by Brill Building pop stalwarts Gerry Goffin and Carole King, based on a title coined by producer Jerry Wexler. One of the landmark performances in pop music, the song floats serenely through the verses until, swept up by Ralph Burns&#39; stirring string arrangement again and again, Franklin opens up on the choruses with one of the most transcendent vocals of her career. And just as she&#39;d previously transformed a soul classic (Otis Redding&#39;s &quot;Respect&quot;) into a signature piece of her own, Franklin courageously reimagined songs by heavyweights James Brown, Ray Charles, and the Impressions. Brown&#39;s &quot;Money Won&#39;t Change You&quot; is smooth and kinetic, her testifying constantly reinforced by interjections from the Sweet Inspirations. Curtis Mayfield&#39;s &quot;People Get Ready,&quot; a 1965 civil-rights anthem and a hit for the Impressions, is taken at a slower pace than the original; after a quiet verse, Franklin lets loose amidst a magisterial brass arrangement by Arif Mardin. Powered by three hit singles (each nested in the upper reaches of the pop Top Ten), Lady Soul became Aretha Franklin&#39;s second gold LP and remained on the charts for over a year.<br /><br />TRACKS:<br />Side One<br />1. &quot;Chain Of Fools&quot; (Don Covay) 2:46<br />2. &quot;Money Won&#39;t Change You&quot; (James Brown, Nat Jones) 2:09<br />3. &quot;People Get Ready&quot; (Curtis Mayfield) 3:42<br />4. &quot;Niki Hoeky&quot; (J.
