Her prose suggests a world of brutality and chaos. Her art has a cheerful, sunny disposition. \u2018Her writing is as fiercely complex and political as her paintings are serenely spare and personal,\u2019 Kaelen wrote in Frieze. At the reading Kaelen repeated a quote Etel once said about her writing and art. \u2018I write what I see, I paint what I am.\u2019 To me, she wrote: \u2018My writing and my paintings do not have a direct connection in my mind. But I am sure they influence each other in the measure that everything we do is linked to whatever we are, which includes whatever we have done or are doing. But in general, my writing is involved with history as it is made (but not only) and my painting is very much a reflection of my immense love for the world, the happiness to just be, for nature, and the forces that shape a landscape.\u2019\u201d<br /><br />Read more of Nana Asfour on the  <a class=\"ot-hashtag\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/s/%23art\">#art</a> \u00a0of Etel Adnan here: <a href=\"http://tpr.ly/Rbo4uS\" class=\"ot-anchor\">http://tpr.ly/Rbo4uS</a>", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12ad1cauua0ujtox04cirz5mvqrej2qkv00k/people/plusoners"}, "replies": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z12ad1cauua0ujtox04cirz5mvqrej2qkv00k/comments"}, "objectType": "note"}, "updated": "2012-10-18T19:14:20.952Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/105374344316230389470", "image": {"url": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-MxLOS_cd5P0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAOb0/GeNdewMG1-0/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "The Paris Review", "id": "105374344316230389470"}, "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "Public"}, "verb": "post", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/rqmqBKU4dytJRB63i-BdC0CbNow\"", "published": "2012-10-18T19:14:20.952Z", "id": "z12ad1cauua0ujtox04cirz5mvqrej2qkv00k"}, "NONE"]
