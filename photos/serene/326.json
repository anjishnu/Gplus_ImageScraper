The word &quot;Halloween&quot; means &quot;hallowed evening&quot; or &quot;holy evening&quot;. It comes from a Scottish term for All Hallows&#39; Eve (the evening before All Hallows&#39; Day). In Scots, the word &quot;eve&quot; is even, and this is contracted to e&#39;en or een. Over time, (All) Hallow(s) E(v)en evolved into Halloween. Although the phrase &quot;All Hallows&#39;&quot; is found in Old English (ealra h\u0101lgena m\u00e6ssed\u00e6g, mass-day of all saints), &quot;All Hallows&#39; Eve&quot; is itself not seen until 1556.<br /><br />Today&#39;s Halloween customs are thought to have been influenced by folk customs and beliefs from the Celtic-speaking countries, some of which have <b>pagan roots</b>, and others which may be rooted in Celtic &#39;Christianity&#39;. Indeed, Jack Santino, an academic folklorist, writes that &quot;the sacred and the religious are a fundamental context for understanding Halloween in Northern Ireland, but there as throughout Ireland an uneasy truce exists between customs and beliefs associated with &#39;Christianity&#39; and those associated with religions that were Irish before &#39;Christianity&#39; arrived&quot;. \u00a0Historian Nicholas Rogers, exploring the origins of Halloween, notes that while &quot;some folklorists have detected its origins in the Roman feast of Pomona, the goddess of fruits and seeds, or in the festival of the dead called Parentalia, it is more typically linked to the Celtic festival of Samhain&quot;, which comes from the Old Irish for &quot;summer&#39;s end&quot;.", "plusoners": {"totalItems": 3, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13zg12remiytjyi504cf1n4pmy2dtir0wk0k/people/plusoners"}, "replies": {"totalItems": 0, "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/activities/z13zg12remiytjyi504cf1n4pmy2dtir0wk0k/comments"}, "id": "z135gfly3ousu31j404cgveiqubaxvb5d0g", "objectType": "activity"}, "updated": "2013-10-31T12:54:44.628Z", "actor": {"url": "https://plus.google.com/117988254110215737900", "image": {"url": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Ys0QPb1YUj4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhxM/4rj80YaytuQ/photo.jpg?sz=50"}, "displayName": "Serene S", "id": "117988254110215737900"}, "access": {"items": [{"type": "public"}], "kind": "plus#acl", "description": "Public"}, "verb": "share", "etag": "\"Mwea3qudNDf-hWWlPWi3n-YrU1Q/0748q0kHCmu-y58dT3T4BHFOOeM\"", "published": "2013-10-31T12:54:44.628Z", "id": "z13zg12remiytjyi504cf1n4pmy2dtir0wk0k"}, "NONE"]
